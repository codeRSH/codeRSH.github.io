<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
You know I have never met you<br />
I tell you, it really sucks<br />
But then, I think it gives me a leverage<br />
And it's not bad as such.<br />
I can think of you,<br />
the hell way I want to,<br />
And there is nothing you can do about it,<br />
until you come and stop me to do.<br />
<br />

And it may seem like a joke,<br />
but I am not joking,<br />
it is true,<br />
Whoever are you, I think of you,<br />
does it really matter,<br />
that I haven't, like ever, met thou?<br />
<br />
Well it has happened with me a million times...<br />
<br />
When I have been giving exams,<br />
and was stuck in a difficult situation,<br />
And then you came in between,<br />
and became my little distraction.<br />
You know it gets difficult to answer questions,<br />
when you are demanding a separate attention.<br />
With all the time that I keep loosing <br />
It's funny it doesn't cause much me tension,<br />
As, without anyone even noticing,<br />
I virtually met you during an examination!<br />
<br />
Sometimes I am reading. something. interesting,<br />
and your thought passes my mind.<br />
I start thinking what you would be reading,<br />
and what thoughts would be in <i>your</i> mind.<br />
And would you be stupid enough,<br />
to think... well... about me.<br />
Or be the smarter one<br />
and keep studying carefree,<br />
And let all the thinking, dreaming<br />
chore, be done by me.<br />
<br />
That day I was taking a walk,<br />
and suddenly the thought crossed,<br />
What you would be doing this evening,<br />
Cooking food, feeding birds,<br />
just having fun doing home stuffs?<br />
Or may be talking to your girlfriends, <br />
on that terrace of yours.<br />
OK, I might be wrong totally,<br />
who knows you may be lazier than <i>The Lazy</i>,<br />
But I am sure that you would be breathing blissfully,<br />
and that's what matters most to me.<br />
<br />
Interestingly as I write these words,<br />
You come again and take that cognitive space.<br />
And well it may seem absurd,<br />
that I don't even require a face.<br />
I have so many thoughts of you,<br />
that I can imagine you with eyes open.<br />
And who would have thought,<br />
that my thoughts about you,<br />
would just be a pinch prettier than yourself!<br />
<br />
And, no. Make no mistake.<br />
I am not complaining.<br />
It's just that you come in thoughts,<br />
When I least expect,<br />
I don't mind, but please knock,<br />
When you come in fact...</div>
