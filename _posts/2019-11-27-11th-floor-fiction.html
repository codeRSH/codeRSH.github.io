<i>Following is a short story I wrote about 5 years ago. This was embedded in my last working day email in my previous organization. I got to read it again today, thanks to a friend. I didn't like it that much at the time I wrote it. But I found it great while rereading it today. So, while I won't be sharing the whole mail, as it was personal and mostly irrelevant to you. But the story is worth sharing. I did a slight one line change at the very end of the story. Enjoy the story and do tell if you like it. I might write another one soon :)</i><br />

<br />
<br />
"Are you going to jump?"<br />
<br />
"I don't know"<br />
<br />
"Standing on the edge of 11th floor balcony and you don't know if you are going to jump?"<br />
<br />
"Yeah, Yeah! I don't know. Shut up!".<br />
<br />
There was silence in the room.<br />
<br />
"Tell me, what do you see Chiraag?"<br />
<br />
"Lots of cars running up and down the road".<br />
<br />
"And?"<br />
<br />
"White headlights on one end and red taillights ​​ on the other side of road. Streaks of white and red painting the black surface. People going home from their offices, back to their loved ones. Everyone in a hurry. It's a mad rush."<br />
<br />
"Anything else you see?"<br />
<br />
"Yes."<br />
<br />
"What?"<br />
<br />
"The dark blue sky mixing with the pale yellow setting sun at the horizon. The darkness... engulfing the city slowly... Stars are coming out of their caves."<br />
<br />
"Isn't it beautiful?"<br />
<br />
"Yes it is"<br />
<br />
"Then why do you want to end your life?"<br />
<br />
"BECAUSE OF YOU!", Chiraag groans. "You have made my life unlivable"<br />
<br />
"But I am your friend."<br />
<br />
"No Sweetu you are not!! You are just a stuffed toy who has driven me to insanity."<br />
<br />
Chiraag looked on his right. A white teddy with a heart in his hand was lying on a brown colored plastic chair. The light was dim but the teddy looked to be smiling.<br />
<br />
"But you always talk to me"<br />
<br />
"Yes, I do. You know why?", Chiraag stopped for a while. "Because, I am... Schizophrenic.". He clinched his teeth.&nbsp; "I didn't believe them earlier. I believed none of them. But now I know, you are not a real person. You are just a stuffed piece of cloth."<br />
<br />
"Don't leave me alone Chiraag. Don't go."<br />
<br />
"Haha, No, Sweetu. I am done with you. All my friends have left me because of you. I can't waste my life anymore with you".<br />
<br />
"Chiraag".<br />
<br />
Chiraag looks at Sweetu. The toy was smiling and seemed to be looking at him. Chirag looked back into its bead like eyes.<br />
<br />
"Won't you stay Chiraag?"<br />
<br />
"NO. NO!"<br />
<br />
The toy's faced turned sombre. "THEN DIE!".<br />
<br />
All of a sudden, the toy's hands grew and&nbsp; pulled the rug under Chirag's feet. Chirag slipped down the balcony. From 11th floor...<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
THUDDD!<br />
<br />
Chiraag woke up. Blood was gushing down his head. But he was still on 11th floor.<br />
<br />
He tried to stand up and searched for a piece of cloth and&nbsp; pressed his wound with it. He realized he had actually fallen from his bed.<br />
<br />
He looked at the wall clock, it was close to 6 in the morning. Sweetu was lying on the chair. Smiling. A stuffed heart in his hand.<br />
<br />
Chiraag speed dialed a number on his phone.<br />
<br />
"Hello Shraddha".<br />
<br />
"Good Morning Chiraag. How are you feeling today?"<br />
<br />
"I am... fine Shraddha. Listen..."<br />
<br />
"Yeah."<br />
<br />
"I want to come and get admitted today."<br />
<br />
"What?! Are you sure? Because you have been asking not to...".<br />
<br />
"Yeah. I think it's time".<br />
<br />
"That's great news Chiraag! I will make all the arrangements inside the hospital soon enough. When are you coming?"<br />
<br />
"I am leaving now."<br />
<br />
The call was disconnected.<br />
<br />
Chiraag stared into the Teddy's bead like eyes again. There was always something engrossing in them. It reminded him of something. Of someone... Who gave him this present.<br />
<br />
"No!"<br />
<br />
There was a white rope lying under the bed. He pulled it out.<br />
<br />
"No!"<br />
<br />
Chiraag tied the white rope in Teddy's neck with one end of the rope and took the other in his own hand.<br />
<br />
He left the room pulling Sweetu with him behind his back. There were elevators at the corner of the floor. But he skipped them and took stairs instead.<br />
<br />
11 flights of stairs. Chiraag was coming down slowly. The white teddy tumbling down behind him.<br />
<br />
People were stopping and giving him way. No one was sure what was going on. Why was a teddy tied to a rope from its neck and being pulled?<br />
<br />
After about 10 minutes, he was out of the apartments and onto the footpath.<br />
<br />
"Bhaiyya".<br />
<br />
Chiraag stopped. He had bare​ly​ walked 50 metres from the gate. There was a little girl of about 10 years age, standing beside him. Already started with her daily occupation. Begging.<br />
<br />
She raised her right hand. "Something to eat?".<br />
<br />
"No, I don't have any money right now".<br />
<br />
She looked at the teddy lying on the road, still tied to him.<br />
<br />
Chiraag knew what she wanted.&nbsp; "You want him?"<br />
<br />
"Yes."<br />
<br />
Chiraag paused for a while. "OK.. But on one condition".<br />
<br />
The girl was looking at him with curious eyes.<br />
<br />
"Play with him sure. But NEVER get attached with him. Do NOT love him.", He took a deep breath.&nbsp; "Or anyone. It will make you mad".<br />
<br />
Girl nodded slightly.<br />
<br />
"Promise me you won't", he paused for a while. ".. love anyone."<br />
<br />
The girl didn't understand what he was saying but she nodded again in affirmative.<br />
<br />
Chiraag smiled. "You will be happy. "<br />
<br />
He put the string in the girl's little hands and walked away. Never looking back again...</div>
