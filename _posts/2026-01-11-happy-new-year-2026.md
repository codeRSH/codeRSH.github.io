(Belated) Happy New Year Everyone! This blog serves both as a reminder of failure and hope to return to the past. I have made so many grand claims about this blog in past many months but haven't really lived up to them till now. But as they say, you haven't failed until you quit trying. So I am not giving up any time soon on this.

Let's go meta this time and talk about what's going on with this blog and why it's not consistently updated. There can be a number of excuses given for this, like not having enough time, "Life taking over" etc. but the simple fact is that it's just laziness and lack of discipline.

After not having time for past almost 10 years can't be a valid excuse!

Another 'valid reason' is perfectionism. I have written about it the past, how 'perfect' is the enemy of good but I tend to forget my own advice.

So, any new year resolutions? I have grown tired for making and breaking them over the years. So, new resolutions as such. However, I just hope to reboot this blog (for real this time!) this year.

Let's see how 2026 goes. My only expectation is that it doesn't get worse if it can't get better than the previous years. See you in a while.
