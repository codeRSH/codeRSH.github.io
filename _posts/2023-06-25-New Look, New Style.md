- # New Look, New Style
  
  ![My Boy](../assets/blog-myboy.png)
  
  **OK so this my yet another way to restart my blogging habit with a new look and style.** The idea as always has been to be able to migrate to completely self hosted platform without having to depend on any other platform. Now while ~~Gitlab~~ Github is not a perfectly _'Self Hosted' Platform_ it does give me some freedom to keep my data with myself.
  
  Moreover, I am trying to take this `whole control` of writing public stuff and keeping personal notes all by myself, so that I get one tool to rule them all.
  
  I think it's been far too long I have been just setting things up but without having to generate anything worthwhile. Now I just hope I am able to do something which will be regular if not frequent and which will be something that people might enjoy reading.
  
  As someone once said :-

  I miss the good old days where I used to be able to write and produce blogs _at will_. I have tried to reboot my writing career so many times but have failed. This is yet another attempt. Probably a little sophisticated one, but let's see how it goes.

  Also the idea is that if this get successful, I would like to migrate my old blogs to this new domain. Let's see how it all goes. Let's all hope this time this attempt is successfully.
