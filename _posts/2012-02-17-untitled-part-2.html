<span style="font-size: large;"><a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2012/02/untitled-part-1-fiction.html">[<b>Previous Part</b>]</a></span>
<span style="font-size: x-large;"><br /></span><br />
<span style="font-size: x-large;">"Oh, there she is!!"</span><span style="font-size: large;"> I exclaimed in my head, being conscious no one should get to know why I was getting so excited in the middle of a packed bus! She was sitting on one of the front seats of the buses while I was hanging at the r<span style="font-size: large;">ear- </span>end. Normally it would have been impossible to locate anyone in this sea of 'cattle class', but I could tell she was "she" from that red butterfly shaped hair clip she was wearing, which I had noticed at the bus stand. <br />&nbsp;</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<div style="font-family: inherit;">
<span style="font-size: large;">Just as I was patting myself in the head for my excellent detective work, the conductor roared, "Ticket!". I found a middle aged man of medium built with a funny little mustache and that classic blue dress and grey colored bag so characteristic of the Indian conductors, standing in front of me. "Ticket!", he shouted again, clearly frustrat<span style="font-size: large;">ed</span> from his job. <br /><br />I desperately thought of a name of some place where this bus was going only to realize I was new to the city! So, I asked him to tell me where was the bus was going. Surprised at my ignorance, he glared at me for a few seconds. And after that, the precision and speed with which he blabbered the incomprehensible names of the all the places the bus was going within the next few seconds, I couldn't help but compare him with my favorite Rap artists. I couldn't even remember the name of last place he said, so I asked him to give me the ticket for the last stop.<br /><br />I could see him clinching his fist<span style="font-size: large;">.</span> <span style="font-size: large;">T</span>he thought of getting kicked out &nbsp;from the moving bus, sent a shiver down my spine! But thankfully, he quickly tore the ticket and asked for 17 Rs. in lieu of that. I quickly searched for a Rs. 10 note and 7 Rs. coins in my wallet and gave it to him and let the poor man free from his misery.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit;">
<span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span></div>
<span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">As I watched him struggle to reach other passengers, I remembered one lady conductor I ran into the first day I got to travel in the buses of this Deccan city. Her sleekness, professionalism and the courtesy was really&nbsp;</span>unforgettable<span style="font-family: inherit;">. Not only did she change my view that only men can be bus conductors, she made me realize that women can do a far better job as a conductor (like in most other areas of life). And surprisingly, passengers themselves behave in a more civilized manner.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">Anyway, back on the target! It was of no use standing at the r<span style="font-size: large;">ear</span> end of the bus when the butterfly-clipped hair were towards the first end. I had to somehow reach there but the task was next to impossible. The crowd in between me and her was so much that even with my wiry body frame, I was sure I would suffocate to death, if I tried to move through it. But it was a risk worth taking! As I slowly started moving ahead, I could feel my pulse rate rising...</span></span><br />
