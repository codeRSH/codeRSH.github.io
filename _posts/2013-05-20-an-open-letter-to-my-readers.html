Dear Reader(s),<br />
<br />
Let me start by thanking you for reading this blog of mine. You might have been following it from its <b><a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2010/07/buzzrsh-when-it-all-started.html">buzzRSH </a></b>days, might have just started reading it, or might have read a few post here and there; I tell you what, you matter to me!<br />
<br />
Every creative person,&nbsp;genius&nbsp;or not, needs an audience. Everytime I post a blog and share it with you, I wait impatiently for your appreciation, and more importantly, your feedback. That is a stamp that I was able to connect with at least a single person, which naturally encourages me to write more stuffs, to explore more ideas. While I might not have been really creative on this blog, I have been an experimenter and the support- direct or indirect- that I have received from you has been invaluable.<br />
<br />
The principles with which I <b><a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2010/04/journey-begins.html">started this blog</a></b>, stand true even today. My first audience is me, and <b><a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2011/01/wibwib-why-i-blog-what-i-blog.html">I am very clear </a></b>about that. But I can't ignore the fact that you have only grown in number over time, and you have spent at least some of your valuable time reading my posts. And so I must apologise that I have not been consistent and I mean really consistent with this blog. It's not fair either to me as a writer or you as a reader.<br />
<br />
Writing is not a child's play. It is easier said than done. Thousands of blogs are made everyday but most of them never get more than a handful updates.&nbsp;Innumerous&nbsp;thoughts revolve around everyone's mind; but to recognise them and to sit and stay with them, to put them cohesively, is matter of practise and discipline. Something that I am still working on.<br />
<br />
In my latest&nbsp;endeavour&nbsp;to recognise what's important in my life, I am trying to <b><a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2013/05/killing-multiple-online-identities.html">take out all the fluff </a></b>out of it. <b><a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2013/05/why-i-am-leaving-facebook-forever.html">I am leaving Facebook</a></b> soon, and I hope that I will now be able to contribute more to both my blogs. But it will also create a huge problem, because Facebook was an important medium for sharing all the new stuff. Without Facebook, it is going to be up to you to do the&nbsp;hard work&nbsp;to find out and read all the latest updates.<br />
<br />
Personally I make use of RSS readers to automatically get new updates of my own favorite blogs. But I know you don't use it. So, I have (re)activated the "Get email updates" functionality. Please do subscribe to this blog through your email ID.<br />
<br />
Your continued support is what I desire. I just wish you could be a little more&nbsp;consistent&nbsp;with your feedbacks. Nevertheless, thanks for what you do! Till next time...<br />
<br />
Yours Truly,<br />
RavS<br />
