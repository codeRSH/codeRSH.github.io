> Aka... **Why did you hit my buffalo with an egg?**

  
Well, I don't know....  
  
**May be I don't like you.** (High possibility. I don't like a lot of people. I am a celebrated two faced)  
  
**May be I don't like bhains.** (Zero probability. Bhains is my favorite animal. Screw you if you don't like Bhains).  
  
**May be I don't like _Your_ bhains.** (May be it's so cool that I am jealous. When I am jealous I do a lot of things.).  
  
**May be I don't like Andaas.** (Of course, I don't like Andaa. I am allergic to it).  
  
**May be I had too many Andaas, I was throwing them out and your bhains just came on the way.** (That's just a sad accident. But the bigger question is from where did I get so many Andaas?)  
  
**May be I just wanted to argue with you.** (Which means either I hate you, or I like you a lot. Like really a lot).  
  
**May be I just wanted you to talk to me, so that I can tell you an important thing.** "Why didn't you call bro?" You ask. **[Well]({% post_url 2011-01-23-that-awkward-phone-conversation %})**. **[Well]({% post_url 2013-05-29-my-phone-my-rules %})**. **[Well]({% post_url 2014-01-01-2014-greatest-year-yet_1 %})**..  
  
**May be I was just aiming at you, but your loyal bhains came in between to save her master.** (Quite a possibility. I have a very bad aim. Besides numerous scientific researches say bhains is more loyal than dogs).  
  
**May be I was just practicing throwing Andaas.** (Who knows throwing Andaas becomes an Olympic sports now that wrestling might not be.).  
  
**May be I saw a killer fly over your bhains, and killed it with my Andaa, thus saving your bhains.** (In which case, you should thank me. And apologize for your bad behavior. In written).  
  
**May be I was just trying to feed your bhains by throwing Andaas at her.** (As I said, I have a very bad aim. Have you ever eaten peanuts by throwing them in air?)  
  
**May be I was juggling with Andaas, and your bhains came in my way deliberately, making me fall down but taking all the Andaas on her.** (I always maintain, Karma is a bitch!)  
  
**May be it was not me who threw Andaas at your bhains. May be it was someone else.** (Go figure out Sherlock. Go!).  
  
**May be your bhains watches too much Saas-Bahu soaps. It threw Andaa on herself and blamed me.** (After all bhains is a female. Saas-Bahu brainwashes all females. All.)  
  
**May be I am a racist and so I threw Andaa at your "black" buffalo.** (Yeah, I am a proud racist. I like to call my black friend "Kaalu".  But then Black is my favorite color. Not a valid reason to throw Andaas at a poor bhains).  
  
**May be you are just drunk.** (Check tomorrow morning. May be I haven't hit your bhains with Andaas after all).  
  
**May be I just wanted to find out, whose bhains is it anyway? Who let the bhains out?**(Ok, now I know, it's you!).  
  
**May be it's you who hit your own bhains with an Andaa and now are trying to put the blame on me.** (What wrong have I done to do you? Please tell me. We can sort it out. No need to bring a bhains in between our personal matters).  
  
**May be it's not me. It's the hen, which gave an Andaa while flying high over your bhains**. (Highly unlikely I know. But Impossible is Nothing. Adidas).  
  
**May be your bhains participated in a talent show, but performed very poorly.** (It's customary to throw Andaas and Tamaatars in such situations. Don't blame me. Blame your bhains).  
  
... There could be a million other reasons. As I said, I don't know.  
  
Long back a great guy told me "_An eye for an eye makes the whole world Bhains ki eye_" (that guy was a drug addict and died prematurely).  
  
Let's forget the past. Stop obsessing  over who hit your bhains with an Andaa. Let's have truce now... Friends?
