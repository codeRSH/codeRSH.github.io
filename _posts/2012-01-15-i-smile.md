I smile.  
Because it takes away all the sadness at that very moment.

I smile.  
Because it makes me feel happy, instantly.

I smile.  
Because it's essential for me, just like breathing.

I smile.

Â and I want to perfect it.

I smile.  
Just to keep seeing, if I can still smile.

I smile.  
Because it's a habit, it's automatic.

![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-b0Z_KYZUz-w/TxMSgRfLrrI/AAAAAAAAAuw/t-EukMDzi2M/s200/IMG_0054.JPG)

I smile.  
Because not smiling sucks.

![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bFl8Q4SgeBU/TxMSiIM5mBI/AAAAAAAAAu4/Da0ytb6ll2Y/s200/IMG_0063.JPG)

I smile.  
Because I like to smile.

![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3aISza1_gAU/TxMSkZ3OmqI/AAAAAAAAAvA/jCiEXXE2zXw/s200/IMG_0066.JPG)

I smile.  
Because there is a huge scarcity of smiles in this world.

![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xwSKi9gxhPc/TxMSmDRuZiI/AAAAAAAAAvI/oT2OIk7hRFc/s200/IMG_0073.JPG)

I smile.  
Because I have the best smile in the world, and I know it!

![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LW5F7JkiwZQ/TxMSnVSHqKI/AAAAAAAAAvQ/K5WATcTeitc/s200/IMG_0076.JPG)

I smile.  
Because a lot of others' smile depends on it.

![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-TvkcoaxCwDM/TxMSo79xSpI/AAAAAAAAAvY/tX0BP1WUW9Y/s200/IMG_0084.JPG)

Because it never hurts.

I smile.  
Because they asked me to do so.  
And I am just keeping my promise.

![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-889S1CSv2qU/TxMSq-0Q7VI/AAAAAAAAAvo/bsSfKko5QkA/s200/IMG_0088a.JPG)

I smile.  
I just don't know the exact reason.

![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--6B21zjTSLc/TxMSscwgTyI/AAAAAAAAAvw/HrVAaESOWhA/s200/IMG_0119.JPG)

Whenever I remember her.

That's how I defeat my enemies.

![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4HfTd_x_lBk/TxMSvxPEdqI/AAAAAAAAAwA/Kwqlsi-l3S0/s200/IMG_0144.JPG)

I smile.  
While talking or walking.  
While eating or drinking.  
While doing anything and everything.

![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ucIuRa7hv6I/TxMSxgjh9OI/AAAAAAAAAwI/nLCbGgnQrvQ/s200/IMG_0147.JPG)

I smile.  
When I wake up, and when I go to sleep.  
And a lot many times in between.

Because I believe in miracles a genuine smile can perform.

![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nqOL5S6A-fg/TxMS7W0jXUI/AAAAAAAAAww/INAZIoU0u-g/s200/IMG_0184.JPG)

I smile.  
...Today because I don't know if I would be there to smile tomorrow.

![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Awr05VwL2io/TxMS91Gd_KI/AAAAAAAAAw4/hGeonN11PBk/s200/IMG_0184a.JPG)

Because it's precious, but still no one can steal it from me.

![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_QDtByhLRmY/TxMTCBwkObI/AAAAAAAAAxI/Kmzro_ZnpI8/s200/IMG_0208.JPG)

I smile.  
Because world walks with me when I smile.  
And when I frown,  
they leave me alone.

![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-k9KuxSOemEM/TxMTFNmJInI/AAAAAAAAAxQ/dqrJ5TQFxWE/s200/IMG_0220.JPG)

Because God made life to be lived this way only.

Because it is a must to get ahead in career ...and in life.

![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EChsR0ya-pM/TxMTK3QVK9I/AAAAAAAAAxo/ikCkCF-hfX8/s200/IMG_0244.JPG)

Because it's safe and has no side effects.

![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZPtQq8uYNdE/TxMTM-aTlqI/AAAAAAAAAxw/svRKAKfwW1c/s200/IMG_0295.JPG)

I smile.  
But I won't tell why.  
Because smiling is something I don't need to justify.

![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1twooOXmpEI/TxMTSk_ZCyI/AAAAAAAAAx4/xUQluf50Pok/s200/IMG_0309.JPG)

![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JvRU4ttXDf8/TxMTaigF7II/AAAAAAAAAyg/JZG2KhXUIfM/s200/IMG_0442.JPG)

Because sometimes, laughing is politically incorrect.

![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mL6GzunZpBI/TxMTcXLLFGI/AAAAAAAAAyo/2pmlVCtMlHk/s200/IMG_0445.JPG)

I smile.  
Because I don't want to regret not smiling later on.

I smile.

![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nXb6PSFJS9k/TxMTtfHpOaI/AAAAAAAAAzw/OnbPzMDwRZo/s200/Srp381.jpg)

I smile.  
Because I have missed a lot of opportunities to do so before.  
But I am not missing any more.

I smile.

Period.

... Dedicated to (and courtesy) my new found friends. Keep smiling :)
