  ![My Boy](../../assets/blog-myboy.png)

  **OK so this my yet another way to restart my blogging habit with a new look and style.** The idea  to do this was to migrate to do self hosting platform without having to depend on any other platform. Now while ~~Gitlab~~ Github is not a perfectly _'Self Hosted' Platform_ it does give me some freedom to keep my data with myself.

  Moreover, I am trying to take this `whole control` of writing public stuff and keeping personal notes all by myself, so that I get one tool to rule them all.

  It took far too long setting things up without producing anything worthwhile. Now I just hope I am able to do something which will be regular if not frequent and which will be something that people might enjoy reading.

  As someone once said :-

  I miss the good old days where I used to be able to write and produce blogs _at will_. I have tried to reboot my writing career so many times but have failed. This is yet another attempt. Probably a little sophisticated one, but let's see how it goes.

## Future plans

  Also the idea is that if this get successful, I would like to migrate my old blogs to this new domain. Let's hope this time the attempt is successfully.

  `PS: Picture of my little boy enjoying his icecream. Of course he didn't eat it. He just 'enjoyed' it!`
