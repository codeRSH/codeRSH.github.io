Chronic Procrastination. That's the word. Waiting for the right time to come to do something worthwhile.

Doing a grand "Go Live" of the new domain. Creating your own Channel and surprising everyone. Basically day dreaming of becoming a hero without doing the work necessary for it.

But at what cost? Forever waiting to start something and just losing time all the time? Is being a hero worth so much lost time?

Why can't we rather I be a normal human being. Accept myself as another creature out of billions just trying to survive and make sense of this world?

Why do I have to be hero and not a person in progress?

Well it's got to stop at some point.
