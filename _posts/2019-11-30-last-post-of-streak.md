I had originally planned to continue this streak till end of the year, breaking my own record on this blog. However, I have decided to take a (hopefully small) break from the streak. I haven't been writing to my liking since past few days. I know it's not easy every day to write fluently, but it shouldn't feel like a chore either. Writing should come from the heart.

Secondly, writing on a daily basis also makes it a chore for your reader too, if they don't really get that much time to read. So, hopefully spacing out the blogs will be better for both me and you. 

I started this streak to prove to myself that I still have it in me to write on a regular basis. I will say that I have been fairly successful in that goal. I completed [3 milestones]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-11-12-post-200 %}) on [each]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-11-22-crossing-400-out-of-1000sher %}) of the [3 blogs](https://medium.com/@medmRSH/50th-post-5aa9426fff5f) in these 30 days. That's been the biggest highlight of this streak, for me.

However, I want to write something meaningful that I myself can enjoy reading sometime in future. I feel some of the past few posts haven't lived up to that mark. 

As I wrote at the start of the month, [I want to write fiction]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-11-04-i-want-to-be-fiction-writer %}). So I will probably try to write a couple of stories in the month of December. No promises, but that's definitely something to try. Most of my [stories]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-11-27-11th-floor-fiction %}) have been based on a vague idea, on which I have just developed the scene as I kept writing. But this time I will try to build a different approach. Probably bring more than 2-3 characters to develop a little more complex story-line, and write the structure before filling the details. That's already making me uncomfortable, so wish me luck. 

Participating and successfully completely [NaNoWriMo](https://www.nanowrimo.org/) is in my bucket list for a very long time. I have even started it a couple of times, but didn't quite complete it. Well, predictably this November also went unsuccessfully. It's been a successful month for me as a blogger but not as a fiction writer. I hope I get to be successful next year. 

As for general blogging that will continue. I have a quite a few topics to write upon but this time I want to take my own time to write, so that real essence of my thoughts can be brought out. 

**PS :** It would also be great if you tell me directly if you want me to write on a particular topic.
