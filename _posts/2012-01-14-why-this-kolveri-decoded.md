Caution: For technical reasons I had to use tiny font size here, but please don't strain your lovely eyes :) Hit (Ctrl + +) or scroll your mouse while pressing Ctrl, to zoom in at a comfortable level. Your eyes are important to me! (after all you are one of the only handful of readers I have got :).

`yo boys i am singing song`                  "The singer makes everyone aware that he is going to sing a song  
`soup song`                                  "You can hear it while eating soup.  
`flop song`                                  "Singer wants everyone to believe it's a flop song so that level of expectations are low

`why this kolaveri kolaveri kolaveri di`     "Kolaveri seems to be a new word learnt by singer so he asks..  
`why this kolaveri kolaveri kolaveri di`     ".."why this Kolaveri word is so popular", from his Di (nick name for sister in Hindi/Bengali)  
`rhythm correct`                             "But since the singer is not sure he asked properly, he corrects his rhythm  
`why this kolaveri kolaveri kolaveri di`     "...And asks again.  
`maintain please`                            "In fact he likes the word so much he wants to...  
`why this kolaveri..di`                      "..Ask again.  

`distance la moon-u moon-u`                  "He tells that the moon is at a very long distance (about 400000 KM to be precise, but that's not important)   
`moon-u  color-u  white-u`                   "Singer thinks that the moon is white in color  
`white background night-u nigth-u`           "But that's because of the Sun's rays, you know the physics, right?  
`night-u color-u black-u`                    "Obviously if there is no moon, night will appear black/dark in color.

`why this kolaveri kolaveri kolaveri di`     "But as soon as the singer realizes he is getting away from the subject,  
`why this kolaveri kolaveri kolaveri di`     "he starts asking again from his Di, "why is this 'Kolaveri' being repeated again & again nowadays?"  

`white skin-u girl-u girl-u`                 "White skin girl? I believe the singer is racist.  
`girl-u heart-u black-u`                     "Thankfully at least he describes her heart has black in color. Though it also shows he wasn't good in Biology.  
`eyes-u eyes-u meet-u meet-u`                "He wants every one to believe that ever since his eyes met the girl's eyes..  
`my future dark`                             "...he isn't sure of his future. That's may be because girl was excellent in   
                                             "studies, but he hasn't had a good academic record  

`why this kolaveri kolaveri kolaveri di`     "Now to distract himself and others from his dark future,  
`why this kolaveri kolaveri kolaveri di`     "the singer starts crooning and asking again: "Why the hell is this kolaveri word so popular?"  

`maama notes eduthuko`                       "To make the song more interesting singer switches to Tamil (I think)  
`apdiye kaila snacks eduthuko`               "But as you can see the choice of words are still poor; who uses 'snacks' in a song?  
`pa pa paan pa pa paan`   
`pa pa paa pa pa paan`                       "Singer seems to have lost his mind at this point. What the heck is pa pa paan?  
`sariya vaasi`                               "No idea about this one. I don't think these are even Tamil words. May be some abusive slang.  
`super maama ready`                          "The singer thinks that his 'maama' (maternal uncle in Hindi) is super (man!).  
`ready 1 2 3 4`                              "He asks his maama to get ready. He even gives time for him to change by counting till 4.  

`whaa wat a change over maama`               "And when maama changes, he can't believe his eyes, how much has the maama changed!  

`ok maama now tune change-u`                 "Now he asks his maama, that since he is busy in singing, "u-change the tune".  

`kaila glass`                                "He starts to sing in Tamil...  
`only english..`                             ".. But he soon realizes his Tamil is very bad. So he promises himself to sing only in English from now on.  

`hand la glass`                              "So now to forget about his dark future he takes a glass in his hand.  
`glass la scotch`                            ".. and fills it with scotch. I am no expert in liqour but I can tell scotch is pretty hard drink.  
                                             "I feel bad for the singer :/  
`eyes-u full-aa tear-u`                      "Now the singer starts to get emotional. Or may be he can't handle strong scotch, so his eyes get full with tears.  
`empty life-u`                               "Oh, now he starts to get philosophical and all. Well, scotch always does that you.  
`girl-u come-u`                              "He again starts remembering the girl  
`life reverse gear-u`                        "..Who came in his life in reverse gear.  
`lovvu lovvu`                                "May be the girl's name was 'lovvu'  
`oh my lovvu`                                "And he wants to tell the world, that 'lovvu' is his only and nobody else's.  
`you showed me bouv-u`                       "But the girl just made him a dog, all he can do now is bouv-u bouv-u.  
`cow-u cow-u holi cow-u`                     "There seems to be a holy cow in his home, since his Di (sister) is not listening...  
`i want u hear now-u`                        ".. he starts talking to cow instead, and hopes at least she will hear and understand his pain.  
`god i m dying now-u`                        "This is pure melodrama, he is fit and fine, you can see the video below.  
`she is happy how-u`                         "It's just that he can't stand to see his 'lovvu' happy. Jealous guy.  

`this song for soup boys-u`                  "The singer tells that this song he wrote for soup boys, i.e. boys who sell soup  
`we dont have choice-u`                      "... because they were so poor in studies (just like him) they don't have any other choice now but to sell soup.  

`why this kolaveri kolaveri kolaveri di`     "Singer wants to end the song on an interrogative note, so he asks   
`why this kolaveri kolaveri kolaveri di`     "again from his Di,  
`why this kolaveri kolaveri kolaveri di`     "and again  
`why this kolaveri kolaveri kolaveri di`     "and again,  "why this Kolaveri?" (In Hindi/Punjabi I would say _"singer ne Kolaveri di waat laga di"_)  

`flop song`                                  "Obviously it's a flop song, but nowadays only flop song are becoming hit.

I am sure the song will never be the same for you again, from now onwards. Watch it one more time!
