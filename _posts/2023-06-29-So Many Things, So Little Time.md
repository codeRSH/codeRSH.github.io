I don't know about you, but as I am getting older I am getting more and more things on my plate. For which sometimes, I think I am not equipped to handle. 

I don't know how a few people are able to achieve so much, while keep on planning stuff without being able to productive that much. 

I might write more about it some other time, because right now my brain is fried enough to think clearly. 

On another note, I should start writing long form blogpost in near future, especially if I have some opinions to give on some of the matters, personal or otherwise.
