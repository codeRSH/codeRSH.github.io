On the first day of this year, I **[had made 12 random]({% post_url 2012-01-01-12-random-wishes-for-2012 %})** top-of-the-mind wishes. Today being the last day of the year, it's appropriate we do a quick review of them. Here we go:

**_1. Sachin gets his 100th 100._**

Yes, he got it, finally! Then he got another one after that. Then he retired from One Day Internationals.

**_2. India wins The Series Down Under._**

They were thrashed 0-4 instead and went Down Under pretty badly. But Dravid getting bowled again and again and again, hurt even more.

**_3. Roger makes it his "Grand Slam" year._**

No he didn't. But he did win his favorite Grand Slam of the year and was there at the top for a brief period of time! Plus this time we had 4 different winners for the 4 Slams, which is happening after a really-really long time in Men's Tennis. Hence, it wasn't bad either.

**_4. MSC wins a race in the last Championship of his life._**

No, he couldn't. And he retired without much fan-fare. But I did attend the Indian GP after all! And I could see him race live in front of my own eyes. It was a dream come true and it was awesome!

**_5. I learn to say "You are Welcome"._**

No, if you come uninvited, I still don't. You are welcome, thank you very much.

**_6. Lokpal Bill gets passed._**

Well some kind of Lokpal Bill did pass in Parliament, but it wasn't the one people were hoping for. Worse, the issue of corruption seems to have gone in cold storage now.

**_7. India wins loads of Golds this Olympics._**

They won none. But they did win 6 medals overall, which was the best performance by the country in terms of the number of medals earned in one Olympics! And that gives hope for a better sports future in India.

**_8. This blog gets even more awesome._**

Well if you consider the number of posts year wise, it has dipped compared to last year. And that is bad, because it shows inconsistency. But if you look at the [**kind of topics**]({% post_url 2012-01-02-why-buffaloes-should-be-declared %}) I have covered and **[the styles]({% post_url 2012-01-15-i-smile %})** I have used, I think the blog DID get even more **[awesome]({% post_url 2012-01-13-soch-raha-hoon %})**! I started a **[novel-style story]({% post_url 2012-02-16-untitled-part-1-fiction %})**, decoded the **[Kolaveri]({% post_url 2012-01-14-why-this-kolveri-decoded %})**, trolled on **[Valentine]({% post_url 2012-02-14-valentine-day-troll-comic %})**, wrote a number of **[poems]({% post_url 2011-08-12-zindagi-mazaak %})** both in [**English**]({% post_url 2012-08-04-have-you-ever-experienced-pain %}) and **[Hindi]({% post_url 2012-02-18-tujhe-tarashne %})**, kept on **[experimenting]({% post_url 2012-05-29-1-week-experiment %})** and introduced a **[brand new blog]({% post_url 2012-06-25-now-introducing-1000-sher %})**. Phew!

**_9. They reconstruct the lanes in my colony._**

Yes, they did construct one lane. But it wasn't the lane passing by my home. It was the lane next to it. Damn sons of politicians!

**_10. I get a girl._**

Yeah, you must laughing your guts out there reading this one. I don't blame you. You earned it!

**_11. I learn Telugu._**

Naaku Telugu Raadhu!.... Happy?

**_12. The world does not end._**

For the kind of negativity that's going around in the world, especially the space nearby me, I wish I hadn't wished for this wish to be true.

Well this year like every other year, wasn't just filled with happy memories, as we wish each other every time on a New Year's Day. There were some bad and some ugly moments as well. But the mixture of all that is what life is about, and that actually is what makes an year memorable. And as you can see in the 12 wishes above, we can wish a lot but the nature has its own way of playing the game. All we can do is to play along with the best of our abilities.

I also want to take this moment to thank each and everyone who were a part of my life in 2012 in anyway, because you shaped how the year turned out to be for me. You might not read this, and you might not reply after reading, but I am grateful to you.

And **2012**, you will be remembered!
