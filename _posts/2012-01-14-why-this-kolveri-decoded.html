<span style="font-size: large;">Caution:</span><span style="color: #e06666; font-size: large;"> For technical reasons I had to use tiny font size here, but please don't strain your lovely eyes :) Hit (Ctrl + +) or scroll your mouse while pressing Ctrl, to zoom in at a comfortable level.

<span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: blue;">why this kolaveri kolaveri kolaveri di </span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Kolaveri seems to be a new word learnt by singer so he asks..</span><br />
<span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: blue;">why this kolaveri kolaveri kolaveri di</span> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;".."why this Kolaveri word is so popular", from his Di (nick name for sister in Hindi/Bengali)</span><br />

<span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: blue;">why this kolaveri kolaveri kolaveri di</span> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"But as soon as the singer realizes he is getting away from the subject,</span><br />
<span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: blue;">why this kolaveri kolaveri kolaveri di</span> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"he starts asking again from his Di, "why is this 'Kolaveri' being repeated again &amp; again nowadays?"</span><br />
