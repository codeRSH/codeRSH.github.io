It's over. Finally it's over. And I can't explain how relieved I feel at this point. Although not as happy as I anticipated (it's always same with any kind of success), I am proud that I kept my promise to myself.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
First and foremost I want to thank everyone with whom I shared my posts. Even though you might not have read even a single post, I had this 'pressure' to come up with something everyday for last 31 days, because I knew at least one of you would be anticipating it in the morning. Without this kind of accountability I am not sure if I would have even reached till Day 10. So Thank You!&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
I didn't "write" every single day, I just published everyday. I had some "ready made" posts, had rough drafts of few posts that I wanted to finish. I also tried to keep myself ahead of the schedule by writing in batches on weekends. But 31 was too large a volume to write. I had some scary days when I would find myself writing late at night so that I could share in the morning. On some days my home internet was not working which meant I wouldn't have been able to post. But, thank God, for making smartphones, mobile internet and USB tethering.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
It wasn't easy. I had to lose 1-2 hours of sleep almost everyday to be able to keep up with the writing schedule. Somedays were particularly difficult when I was dead tired and I would just want to hit the sack but had to keep myself awake to review/write a post. I also <b><a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2014/01/about-broken-promises.html">broke a number of promises</a></b>, and am way behind <b><a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2014/01/2014-greatest-year-yet_1.html">my other resolutions</a></b> .<br />

Not all the posts were particularly inspiring to write. Some I personally thought could have been better, but I had to post anyway for the lack of time. And, I couldn't come up with the debut episode of podcast which was a huge disappointment personally.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
There were some surprises too. I thought the <b><a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2014/01/all-hail-buffalo-part-ii.html">All Hail Buffalo post</a></b> would gain a lot more popularity, but it didn't. <b><a href="http://1000sher.tumblr.com/post/72692916573">Same</a></b> was <b><a href="http://1000sher.tumblr.com/post/73006542765/there-was-blood">the case</a></b> with all <b><a href="http://1000sher.tumblr.com/post/73911163729/how-to-write-a-poem">3 poems</a></b>. On the other hand, there were <b><a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2014/01/untitled-part-8.html">some posts</a></b> which got a lot more popular than expected.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
I tried to do everything I could think of this month. I wrote from <b><a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2014/01/how-to-talk-to-girl-you-like-without.html">love</a></b> to <b><a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2014/01/on-following-porn-star.html">porn</a></b> to <b><a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2014/01/abap.html">politics</a></b> to <b><a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2014/01/how-to-maximize-number-of-likes-you-get.html">humor</a></b> to <b><a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2014/01/resetting-priorities.html">personal</a></b> to <a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2014/01/experience-of-working-in-indian-it.html"><b>professional</b></a>. <a href="https://medium.com/p/4413202712ad"><b>Short ones</b></a>, as well as the <b><a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2014/01/lessons-learned-from-training-and.html">long ones</a></b>. The <b><a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2014/01/should-we-let-people-become-god.html">commentary</a></b>, the <b><a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2014/01/blog-post.html">stories</a></b>, the <b><a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2014/01/abap.html">satires</a></b>, the <b><a href="http://1000sher.tumblr.com/post/73006542765/there-was-blood">poems</a></b>, the <b><a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2014/01/ek-ladki-ko-dekha-to-aisa-laga-reprise.html">songs</a></b>. There were a few Hindi stuffs mixed with mostly English. I even wrote about some <a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2014/01/i-am-depressed.html"><b>deeply personal</b></a> stuffs that I had to think multiple times before posting. I dared to try <b><a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2014/01/8-months-without-fb-and-still-running.html">different</a> <a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2014/01/an-open-letter-to-friend.html">styles</a></b>. I <a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2014/01/i-want-gay-friend.html"><b>dared to be honest</b></a> in my writing. I was <b><a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2014/01/the-ravs-and-art-of-changing-hair-styles.html">scared</a></b> I would be chided about some of the stuffs, but thankfully people understood (or just didn't care).</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Some of you gave feedback and valuable comments on some of the articles. They were mostly words of appreciation which acted as a fuel to keep me going, and also some criticism here and there (people who provide constructive criticism are my favorite, you deserve a treat from me!).&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
I know I wrote so much that some of you had difficulty keeping up. I apologize for it, but that's the way it was going to be. I will keep <a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2014/01/february-toughest-month-yet.html"><b>February</b></a> quite cold on writing front, so that we can come on the same page.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
As I hoped, I have been able to clear my back log of ideas, so the new posts would be on fresh &nbsp;ideas! You have given me some interesting ideas to write about, a lot of which are really difficult for me to attempt as a writer. Thanks for trusting me with that. I hope I won't disappoint when I attempt some of them.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
I made a few new fans of the <b><a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2012/02/untitled-part-1-fiction.html">"Untitled" story</a></b> and took it forward. I promise I will be completing it this year only, with a few more parts coming in February.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
At one point I even thought to make it a 50 day challenge and I know I could complete that too. But it's not worth the effort now. Other aspects of my life are getting affected due to this. So now for the rest of the year, I will try to write few but more awesome (read deep, passionate, embarrassing, untried of) topics.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Now if you stayed with me from the starting up to this sentence, I ask you of one last thing: <b>What was your favorite post(s) and why?&nbsp;</b></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Thanks again from the bottom of my heart. I am grateful you spared time to read me :)</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<b>PS:</b> I hope you remember <b><a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2014/01/about-broken-promises.html">my challenge for February</a></b>. ;)<br />
