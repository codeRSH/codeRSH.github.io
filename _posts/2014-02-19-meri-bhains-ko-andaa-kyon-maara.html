<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Aka... <b>Why did you hit my buffalo with an egg?</b></blockquote>
<br />
Well, I don't know....<br />
<br />
<b>May be I don't like you.</b> (High possibility. I don't like a lot of people. I am a celebrated two faced)<br />
<br />
<b>May be I don't like bhains.</b> (Zero probability. Bhains is my favorite animal. Screw you if you don't like Bhains).<br />
<br />
<b>May be I don't like <i>Your </i>bhains.</b> (May be it's so cool that I am jealous. When I am jealous I do a lot of things.).<br />
<br />
<b>May be I don't like Andaas.</b> (Of course, I don't like Andaa. I am allergic to it).<br />
<br />
<b>May be I had too many Andaas, I was throwing them out and your bhains just came on the way.</b> (That's just a sad accident. But the bigger question is from where did I get so many Andaas?)<br />
<br />
<b>May be I just wanted to argue with you.</b> (Which means either I hate you, or I like you a lot. Like really a lot).<br />
<br />
<b>May be I just wanted you to talk to me, so that I can tell you an important thing.</b> ("Why didn't you call bro?" You ask. <b><a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2011/01/that-awkward-phone-conversation.html">Well</a></b>. <b><a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2013/05/my-phone-my-rules.html">Well</a></b>. <b><a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2014/01/2014-greatest-year-yet_1.html">Well</a></b>.).<br />
<br />
<b>May be I was just aiming at you, but your loyal bhains came in between to save her master.</b> (Quite a possibility. I have a very bad aim. Besides numerous scientific researches say bhains is more loyal than dogs).<br />
<br />
<b>May be I was just practicing throwing Andaas.</b> (Who knows throwing Andaas becomes an Olympic sports now that wrestling might not be.).<br />
<br />
<b>May be I saw a killer fly over your bhains, and killed it with my Andaa, thus saving your bhains.</b> (In which case, you should thank me. And apologize for your bad behavior. In written).<br />
<br />
<b>May be I was just trying to feed your bhains by throwing Andaas at her.</b> (As I said, I have a very bad aim. Have you ever eaten peanuts by throwing them in air?)<br />
<br />
<b>May be I was juggling with Andaas, and your bhains came in my way deliberately, making me fall down but taking all the Andaas on her.</b> (I always maintain, Karma is a bitch!)<br />
<br />
<b>May be it was not me who threw Andaas at your bhains. May be it was someone else.</b> (Go figure out Sherlock. Go!).<br />
<br />
<b>May be your bhains watches too much Saas-Bahu soaps. It threw Andaa on herself and blamed me.</b> (After all bhains is a female. Saas-Bahu brainwashes all females. All.)<br />
<br />
<b>May be I am a racist and so I threw Andaa at your "black" buffalo.</b> (Yeah, I am a proud racist. I like to call my black friend "Kaalu". &nbsp;But then Black is my favorite color. Not a valid reason to throw Andaas at a poor bhains).<br />
<br />
<b>May be you are just drunk.</b> (Check tomorrow morning. May be I haven't hit your bhains with Andaas after all).<br />
<br />
<b>May be I just wanted to find out, whose bhains is it anyway? Who let the bhains out?</b>(Ok, now I know, it's you!).<br />
<br />
<b>May be it's you who hit your own bhains with an Andaa and now are trying to put the blame on me.</b> (What wrong have I done to do you? Please tell me. We can sort it out. No need to bring a bhains in between our personal matters).<br />
<br />
<b>May be it's not me. It's the hen, which gave an Andaa while flying high over your bhains</b>. (Highly unlikely I know. But Impossible is Nothing. Adidas).<br />
<br />
<b>May be your bhains participated in a talent show, but performed very poorly.</b> (It's customary to throw Andaas and Tamaatars in such situations. Don't blame me. Blame your bhains).<br />
<br />
... There could be a million other reasons. As I said, I don't know.<br />
<br />
Long back a great guy told me "<i>An eye for an eye makes the whole world Bhains ki eye</i>" (that guy was a drug addict and died prematurely).<br />
<br />
Let's forget the past. Stop obsessing &nbsp;over who hit your bhains with an Andaa. Let's have truce now... Friends?<br />
