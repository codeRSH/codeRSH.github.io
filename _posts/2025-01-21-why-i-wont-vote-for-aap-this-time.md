First let me start with the admission that I have been an AAP supporter, admirer and voter for many years. I even wrote a (blog 11 years ago)[2013-11-30-10-reasons-why-i-am-voting-for-aap-and] explaining my reason for enthusiasm for this party and encouraging others to support it. I would also like to place on record that I used to vote for Congress during Sheila ji's time and gladly voted for Mr. Modi in 2014 when there was a euphoria for 'Acche Din'. 

All this to establish that I am not bound any particular party's ideology. I am a so called 'floating voter' and only care for the welfare and improvement of conditions of my family, my surrounding, my city and my country. So, I write this not as a supporter of any party but as a concerned citizen.  

## AAP's Criticism
Over the years the enthusiasm with this party has come done substantially. 

But they have now become just like any other party. There are no filters on who they admit in their party. No place for descent. Not giving a chance to those who deserve to be at the top and being opaque in some of the inner party activities. 'Sheesh-Mahal' controversy is mostly politics. When every CM and PM of India lives in a good condition then the Delhi CM also deserves a descent Housing. But when you launch yourself as someone who doesn't desire 'Bangla-Gaadi' and make a show of how much an 'Aam Aadmi' you are, then on the other hand 'accepting' to live in such lavish house makes you a Hypocrite and is an open invitation to get fingers pointed on yourself. 

But personally, I don't care much about the politics till the time Janta's work is being done. AAP's first term did bring some noticable changes in Delhi. They had done a good job in some areas like education and healthcare infrastructure and improving the conditions of many unauthorized colonies by providing basic facilities. So I willingly voted for them in 2020. But past 5 years have been huge disappointment. 

There have been some thigns like Covid which were beyond control. 

## What about this? 
While these parties continue to give freebies as if it's their Dad's money, no one talks about the main concerns which affects each and every Delhite irrespective of their class. 

The capital of India is the proud owner of the tag of most polluted city in the world. The Govt officials from other countries try to avoid getting posting in this city. The Air Pollution is killing every one bit by bit daily. The winters are obviously unlivable but the condition isn't rosy during the summers either. We Delhites have got used to the whole drama during winter time. The deadly smog would return like clock work, people would start complaining for being unable to breath. Agencies will create a smoke-screen of how they are working round the clock to improve the condition by bring in GRAP measures. Opposition parties will blame Delhi Govt as if rest of the North India is breathing extremely clean air. While the Delhi Govt instead of doing their part, will be ready with their usual defenses like it's happening due to other states, the pollution in other cities are much worse etc. Supreme court will come and reprimands everyone to behave. Meanwhile ordinary people will squabble on the 'right to burn crackers' and how this equates to Hindu Dharma etc. The drama goes on for 2-3 months, then conditions improve slightly and it's not 'that worse' anymore, and so everyone forgets about it. No substantial change and so we wait for baited breath (pun intended) for next winters to come. 

The problem is that there is truth in everyone's arguments. It's true that Delhi Govt not doing nearly enough to combat this menace. And it's also true that this a problem of whole of North India (and neighboring countries). But this is a matter of life and death. Instead of playing polities on it, this should be considered as a Health Emergency and immediate, uncomfortable and unpopular measures need to be taken to improve conditions of Indians and Delhites. I for my part am willing to make sacrifices if it allows my future generations to have a better and decent future. We might be still a poor and developing country but we still don't deserve to live and be treated like cockroaches. 

The condition of Yamuna is a blot to our city and country. It is virtually a drain which you won't even want to stop for a second and have a look while passing by. And this when we get majority of our water requirement from this river. For years and years I have been hearing about plans to clean the river but its condition has only worsened if anything. Rivers in other cities and countries have substantially improved, so I can not believe it's an impossible task. All it needs is to political will and setting the priorities right. But when the incumbent CM openly says that we don't get votes on the basis of Yamuna, it's evident where the priorities are. And well while the other parties are quick to  criticize the Govt they don't have any concrete plan of their own to clean the "Holy River" if they come to power. 

I have been reading news for past 20 years or so and one thing I can guarantee are the news articles where the Govt Agencies like MCD, PWD and DDA promise they have cleaned all the big water drains and then after a days those same drains overflowing and causing water logging everywhere and sometimes even flood like situation. It's an yearly joke which is even older than the Air Pollution Drama. 

Even the basic solvable issues like overflowing drains in colonies and garbage management, local road infrastructure is not being looked into. Wherever you go there is garbage. Nothing substantial was done when BJP was in power in MCD for 15 years and nothing is changing now when AAP has come to power. So there is no difference whoever you vote. These guys will just make hollow promises and show rosy picture to take your votes and then keep making a fool out of you for next 5 years.  


## Why I am hopeless?

Politics in our city and generally in our country has been reduced to giving freebies. Also encourage you to watch this video to understand what this is doing to our country and its future. 

No political party has any vision to make this city/state better in next 5 years. No one has elaborated any plan or even hinted on solving the age old problems i listed above. Freebies are the easiest and laziest way to 'buy' the votes and then remain unaccountable as long as you keep taking our money (through taxes) from one hand and give it back like alms (through freebies) in the other hand. 

So, let any party come to power, I am convinced nothing substantial is going to change in this NCT region in next 5 years. The problems I listed will remain the same more or less and we citizens will accept our fate (or leave the place if we can). It's a sad and depressing situation. And there is no hope of anything better in coming days.
