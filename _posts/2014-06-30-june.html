In the middle of June, I conceived a project which had a high potential to fail. Usually I write poems and friends read them. So, I tried to turn the tables. I tried to involve as many friends as I could to write a "Group Poem". Some of them responded. Only a few of them could muster up some lines.<br />
<br />
I set a few rules at the start. Two (or more) lines from each person. ABAB rhyming scheme. The rhyming words. Also, the time to respond &nbsp;(24 hours). By the time we reached the end of "June" (!), each one of these rules were destroyed one by one.<br />
<br />
I wasn't allowed to moderate the poem, so anything was allowed (except obscenity) as far as the content was concerned. So, it turned out to be anything but what I imagined it would turn out to be. But it was an interesting group experiment overall.<br />
<br />
Thanks Namrata, Akshita, Katyayan, Anshul and Srijan for the contribution...<br />

<i>The wheatish white girl's name was June.&nbsp;</i><br />
<i>And she had one dirty little secret to keep.&nbsp;</i><br />
<i>The copper haired girl's antics were jejune</i><br />
<i>And some very ordinary things made her flip.</i><br />
<i>Those sparkling eyes, made me think, God is too Prune,&nbsp;</i><br />
<i>Greenish-Blue hue, those were sea-like deep.</i><br />
<i>Litting up the room, like a sunlight dune,&nbsp;</i><br />
<i>She smiles her way, up the stairs so steep.</i><br />
<i>Why is she here?, I ask myself,</i><br />
<i>breaking my thought there is a Warning Beep.</i><br />
<i><br /></i>
<i>It was last year on June 22 when i had proposed her at half past five.&nbsp;</i><br />
<i>Long day it was , longest as they say , as i stood there forever. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</i><br />
<i>She &nbsp;smiled as usual, ruffled my hair and said "oh! Baby I love Clive.</i><br />
<i>Then and there I vowed to myself, ''never fall for her ever''.</i><br />
<i><br /></i>
<i>My charming frog never got the kiss,</i><br />
<i>Yelped in the night without a pretty miss,</i><br />
<i>The rejection took away all my bliss,</i><br />
<i>I fasted to an emotional abyss.</i><br />
<i><br /></i>
<i>Years then passed and i forgot her face,</i><br />
<i>Mostly because I showered her with mace,</i><br />
<i>Flew her with a tiger into outer space,</i><br />
<i>Denied her existence in the human race.</i><br />
<i><br /></i>
<i>Till one fine day as I walked with a teddy bear,</i><br />
<i>I saw her frying onions on a stand with silly hair,</i><br />
<i>Screaming to the crowd at the city's market square,</i><br />
<i>Desperately in need of some fine dental care.</i><br />
<i><br /></i>
<i>I went to her,&nbsp;</i><br />
<i>and found she had nothing to cheer,</i><br />
<i>Shouted on me as if i have stolen something from her</i><br />
<i>June i knew was not in there...</i><br />
<i><br /></i>
<i>But as I approached her, she shot me with a gun,&nbsp;</i><br />
<i>She was a spy of another country, an intelligence agent.&nbsp;</i><br />
<i>Her antics, her secrets were out in the open now,&nbsp;</i><br />
<i>But there was nothing that I could do as blood poured out of my mouth.&nbsp;</i><br />
<i>I loved the copper haired girl with greenish blue eyes,&nbsp;</i><br />
<i>I had vowed not to fall for her, but she made sure I fall forever tonight.</i></div>
