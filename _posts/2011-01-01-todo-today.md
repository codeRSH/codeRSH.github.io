People say whatever you do on first day of the year, you tend to repeat the whole year. Last time, the first thing I did when clock rang 12 was to call XP and chatted with him for some good time. Had a tiff with him for sometime of the year!

Anyway, that won't stop me from making a todo for the first day of the first year of the second decade of present millennium. 

Will try and do them in the order presented but that's not a hard and fast rule.

1.  **Write todo** (what am I doing right now, dummy?)
2.  **Post a blog** (just as you read this you know it's done)
3.  **Bath in the morning** (Well, holiday and winter shouldn't be an excuse at least today)
4.  **Pray** (So finally God gets an appointment from my busy schedule :)
5.  **Meditate** (Sounds cheesy but I fully understand the importance of it)
6.  **Take blessings from family elders** (no scientific advantage of this practice but invaluable morally)
7.  **Read Newspaper** (Nowadays like supplements more than the main newspaper... No more scams please)
8.  **Watch a movie/TV episode** (well if you know you are going to do it on a holiday why be ashamed to announce it)
9.  **Call/Chat with close friends** (not those whom I met in person today!)
10.  **Way2SMS rest** (well even Tata Indicom takes premium charges for SMS on special occasions, so Way2SMS rules, but only if it's working)
11.  **Scrap 'bache-kuche'** (hey so don't blame me, I don't have their numbers. Plus its reminder to me and others that I am still alive on Orkut :)
12.  **Program** (Lets actually do it instead of pretending to do. How about printing 'To hell with world' in five different languages?)
13.  **Study** (Hey RavS you are still a student, remember? When was the last time I voluntarily studied? hmm..)
14.  **Meet YogS in person** (_Kitna pyaara vaada hai!_)
15.  **Meet YogS on time** (No comments)
16.  **Go to Sector 6 Market** (Best Hangout in the whole world!!.. Well actually its because of lack of better hangouts)
17.  **Buy an electronic gadget** (lets continue the tradition, transistor radio will do for today)
18.  **Check Google Reader** (Old habits die hard)
19.  **Help bros/sis** (when you have so many siblings to choose from and you are the eldest, you got some moral obligations to fulfil)
20.  **Sleep early** (Hehe.. Are you kidding?!)

And here are 11 fillers to be done at some point or another through the day.

1.  **Tweet with PK** (who else listens anyway?)
2.  **'Like'/Comment your own tweet on Buzz** (Buzz is a flop ;( )
3.  **Do something never done before** (oh well that will be adventurous, but what??)
4.  **Ridicule Sui** (ohh.. I miss good old times)
5.  **Read Katy's :(old) poem** (it's been a long time since...)
6.  **Make fun of an XP SMS** (well his SMS are an invitation to get creative, I can't help myself)
7.  **Argue with VK on a trivial issue** (He loves a good debate, I love giving a good debate)
8.  **Talk to a friend not in contact for 5 years** (friends are like wine, the older the better (though have never tasted wine so can't vouch for it))
9.  **Don't open 'Windows'** (Nowadays I don't have too many Windows anyway. Just 7 in the whole home ;)
10.  **Listen to music** (Obvious)
11.  **Admire a jhand art** (_artist jhand ho sakta hai, uska art nahin_)
  
So, looks like I have got a packed 1st January. Hopefully I will have packed and happening year too. Here is wishing you the same!

**Happy New Year MMXI**
