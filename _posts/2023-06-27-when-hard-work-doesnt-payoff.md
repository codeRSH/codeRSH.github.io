Since yesterday I was trying to make something work in a software for which the software wasn't designed for in first place. I spent almost 10+ hours trying to make it work but finally gave up now.

I have developed a decent workflow publishing on [both](https://ravs.in) [my blogs ](https://1000sher.in)which albeit requires an extra step from drafting to making it public. Trying to eliminate that extra stuff made me lose so much time.

It's disappointing but I hope I learnt something from it, and it wasn't an utter waste. Failures in life are as important as the Successes.
