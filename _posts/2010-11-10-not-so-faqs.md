**Who are you?**
Hi, first of all,  thank you for visiting this page, for finding out more about me and my blog! My real name is **Ravi Singh**, but I prefer to call myself [**RavS**]({% post_url 2011-07-28-battle-royale-ravs-vs-ravi %}), so you can call it my pen name. I am a ~22~ ~26~ 36 years  old Indian. Techie by profession, blogging is my hobby.

To know more about me **[please read this]({% post_url 2011-10-02-myself %})**.

**What's the story behind this blog?**
There is an interesting (or boring depending on how you perceive it) [**story behind this blog**]({% post_url 2011-09-10-anosm-blog-story-after-one-year %}) and the journey so far. While blogging remains a hobby I am quite serious about it and take it as an **[Engineering task]({% post_url 2011-07-06-engineering-blog-post %})**.

**Why this blog?**
As I said blogging is my hobby and I have wanted to be a blogger for a long-long time (circa 2007 to be precise).  I am trying to develop it into a habit/passion. There are a number of reasons why I blog, you may want to read [**this post**]({% post_url 2011-01-29-wibwib-why-i-blog-what-i-blog %}) to know more.

**How often do you update your blog?**
Ideally, I would like to post at least one blog per week. But as you know, nothing in this world is ideal :) I have hit writer's block so many times I don't post for several weeks. But there have been some weeks where the blog gets flooded with posts, but rest assured this blog is really important for me.

**Do you write anywhere else too?**
Well, right now this is my main blog. I am also trying to develop a little blog called **[1000Sher](https://1000sher.in/)** to indulge into my creative side more often. Before making this blog public, I used to write at [**thinkXP.blogspot.com**](https://thinkxp.blogspot.com/) (where you can still find some of my blog posts and associated comments). I also have recently started writing on **[Medium](https://medium.com/@medmRSH)**.

**What blogs do you like to read?**

Usually I like to read about **[technology](https://www.thinkdigit.com/)** which specifically includes **[Linux](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk//)** and **[Writing](https://writetodone.com/)**.
