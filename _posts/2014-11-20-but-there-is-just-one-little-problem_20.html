<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Aakash shirked his head and focused on the road.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"You should think about what I just said Aakash. I can see hunger in your eyes. But you must learn to channel your energy. You deserve to get what you desire". Raashi said.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Aakash took a few deep breaths, "I get you Raashi.. I..".</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
And there was silence. Aakash stopped his vehicle at the next traffic light. Aakash felt guilty inside. What was this girl doing to him.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Two little kids came on Rashi's side and started asking for alms. Raashi immediately looked into her purse, but she didn't have any change. She looked at Aakash. Aakash took out a 100 Rs. note from his wallet and gave to her.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Are you sure?", Raashi said taking the note. Aakash nodded. &nbsp;He didn't want to say&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"You are pretty kind-hearted Aakash", Raashi smiled as she opened the window pane and handed over the note to the elder one.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
She inquired about their names and ruffled their hair and let them go. The two kids ran away.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Well thank you". Raashi said closing the window pane. Aakash smiled.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"There are so few givers in this world Aakash. Everyone wants to get something. Everyone is lusting about something or the other. Money, power, fame, sex, prestige. I liked that in you. I wish I had infinite powers, I would take away the pain of everyone in this world. Their loneliness.... "</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
She seemed so excited while talking. As if this was the first time she was allowed to talk. But Aakash wasn't much interested in her talks. He was looking how her eyebrows would move, how her nose would flare up and how she would pout in between the sentences. Her Adam's apple was suprisingly quite visible. It would move up and down as she spoke. All this mixed with her kind, loving nature overwhelmed him. He just wanted to bring her closer to himself, and kiss her. Just fill her face in his hands and... He moved his hands a little towards her...&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
The traffic signal got green and the vehicles behind started honking. Aakash started his duster again. He hoped Raashi didn't notice his advances.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Raashi switched on the music player, but there were only old 60s and 70s songs. She fibbled with the tracks for a few minutes and then she turned it off abruptly.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"God... Aakash. What are you? Like 60 year old man? What do you listen to? How does your girlfriend even bear you?".</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"I don't have a girlfriend."</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"What!!", Raashi shouted as if Aakash had just confessed his homosexuality.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"What happened". Aakash said, a little embarrassed.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"I am sure you aren't married yet. How come you don't have a girlfriend living in a metro like Mumbai. Do you have any.. uhhmm... problem?"</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"What do you mean problem", Aakash shot back.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"No I mean... ", Raashi smiled mischiveously.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"I had a girlfriend 3 years back. We broke up for some reason. Didn't find another girl after that. Wasn't interested. End of story", Aakash said in a single breath.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Ohhh.. I am sorry. You still talk to your ex?".&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"No I don't. I haven't talked to her since. She must be married now. I am done with her.".&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"May I know what happened", Raashi was careful with her words. She didn't want to flare up old wounds unnecessarily. But she couldn't contain her curiosity either.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Aakash didn't say anything. &nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"It's OK, if you don't want to talk about it".&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
There was silence for sometime.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"She liked me but didn't want to go against her parent's wishes. It's the same old story. I don't know why they hook up in the first place then. I don't want to talk about it Raashi.".</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"That's OK. I understand. I understand". Raashi said trying to calm him down.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
The road was clear ahead, Aakash raised the speed of the car. Raashi looked the other side of the window. No one was talking now.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Aakash are you virgin?".&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Aakash hit the break hard. Car came to a halt in 3 seconds.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Raashi started laughing hysterically again. "Hahaha, oh, I am so sorry, I am so sorry. I didn't mean to startle you. Hahaha...".&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Aakash was expressionless. He was more than shocked this time. What was wrong with this girl?</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"But you didn't answer my question!", she was just unable to stop giggling.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Do you want me to kick you out of the car?".&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Oh, no no. Poor baby. OK, I will shut up now. Promise". She &nbsp;put a finger on her lips. Silence ensued again. But she would keeping looking at Aakash every now and then.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"No, I am not". Aakash said slowly after sometime.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Oh, really! So...".&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"And, no I don't want to discuss my sex life with you.", He cut her before she could finish her sentence.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Haha, alright. Keep your sex life with yourself. I won't tell mine either.", she patted his back.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
There was silence. Two strangers sitting next to each other inside a moving car, &nbsp;talking about their sex life. The evening was getting weirder for Aakash.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"For the record, I don't believe your answer", Rashi said. Aakash didn't answer.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Hey my stop came! Just drop me at the next red light".&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Aakash followed the orders.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Alright, Aakash. Thank you, thank you so much. You are such a sweetheart. I hope we crash again someday". Raashi opened the gates of the car.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Raashi".&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Yaa...".&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Can we... Can we meet sometime this weekend for a cup of coffee?".&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Raashi smiled mixed with her typical mischief.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Yeah sure, we can meet.".&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"Great!". A sense of excitement was visible in Aakash's face.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"And then of course we can meet the next weekend for another cuppa coffee. And, then probably for dinner, a few movies, a few outings every now and then, whenever we can make time. I mean this is how it typically starts right?" .&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Aakash couldn't follow what she was saying. He remained silent.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Raashi continued..."And soon enough we would be hooked. You would be sharing our pictures together on social networks, you would discuss me in your friend circle. And after a few months, if everything goes fine, you might even introduce me to your parents. It's all fine Aakash, it feels so exciting. Yay!"</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
She raised her fists in the air mocking excitement.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"But there's just one little problem..." She stopped.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"What?", Aakash said in a hushed tone.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
She smiled and closed the gate of the car. She took her lips closer to Aakash's ears and whispered... &nbsp;"I am a prostitute".&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Aakash kept staring at the windshield. He couldn't register what he heard.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"People of your stature and background don't marry Call Girls. Do they Aakash?", Raashi smiled.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Aakash didn't say a word. He didn't move his head.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"I sat in your car to make money for the day. I saw how you were looking at me. But you didn't make a move. Clients recognize people like us from our Red umbrella or handkerchief. But you didn't. You haven't visited a prostitute before Aakash. Now, have you?".&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
She leaned at Aakash again, and slowly kissed him on the cheeks. Then she slowly took out the handkerchief from her purse and cleaned the lipstick smudge from his face. &nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
"You are a nice guy Aakash. I hope one day God gives you what you are looking for. But I can't provide you that. "&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Aakash looked at Raashi, but didn't utter anything.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
She patted him on the cheeks. "You chose the wrong girl again Aakash. I am so sorry".&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Raashi got out of the car immediately. Outside, she opened her Red umbrella, probably and started walking away.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
It was still raining heavily. Aakash looked ahead through his car's windshield. A yellow figure with red on top, walking away slowly. Fading. And fading. And fading...</div>
