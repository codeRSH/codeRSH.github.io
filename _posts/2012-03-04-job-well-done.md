As I opened my eyes,  
the head still pounding,  
consciousness coming and going,  
the mouth tasting like vomit,  
the veins trying to bust into pieces,  
breath playing hard to catch up,  
hands paralyzed, legs feeling crippled.

As I lay there in pool of own blood and sweat,  
clothes torn, soiled, hair ruffled,  
I saw the faces of my fam and friends,  
the pride in their eyes, the smile on their faces.  
At that moment, at that very moment,  
the only noise that was impeding between the ears,  
was of my own conscience.  
It was shouting, voice mixed with relief and excitement,  
"Job well done, Job well done, Job well done"...
