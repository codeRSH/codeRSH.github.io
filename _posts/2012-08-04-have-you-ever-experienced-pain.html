<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
<br />
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">No, not the kind that comes and goes,</span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">The one that just stays and refuses to leave,</span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">The one that seeps through the skin,</span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">slowly pierces the heart and starts dissolving into your soul.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;"><br /></span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">The pain that makes you weak, every second, every moment,</span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">The pain that increases inch by inch, till you get overwhelmed,</span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">The pain that reminds you, I am here. Today, tomorrow, forever.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">The pain that becomes your very identity.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;"><br /></span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">Everyday, from inside, you die a thousand deaths,</span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">You know you want to live, but the pain makes giving up so much easier,</span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">You want to cry, wail for help,</span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">But you can't, your are pain's prisoner.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;"><br /></span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">The desperation in the eyes of dear ones,</span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">Their infinite failed attempts of consolation,</span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">The frailing ray of hope,</span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">The knowledge that you just cannot win.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;"><br /></span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">Have you ever experienced such excruciating, such mind numbing pain?</span><br />
