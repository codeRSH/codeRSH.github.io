Following is some advice I captured while hearing podcast from Mel Robbins. I found it useful so I thought I might just share it with you as well. 

She says the Perfect Morning Routine starts with fixing your Evening Routine. Here are some of her tips :

- **3-2-1 Rule:**
	- 3 hours before sleep : Stop eating/ drinking
	- 2 hours : Stop working
	- 1 hour : Stop all screens
- Make it easier to jump start your morning, the night before.
	- "Flush the Toilet"/ Wash the Dishes/ Do a Clean Slate at the evening time
- Be _intentional_ about your alarm and think how much time do you need for yourself, for your physical and mental health before you start your day .
	- Probably 90 mins or so without feeling rushed.
	- Make yourself a promise at evening that you will wake up at the alarm time. This will change your thinking about yourself .
- Remove the phone from bedroom . Pick a spot to charge your phone out of bedroom.
