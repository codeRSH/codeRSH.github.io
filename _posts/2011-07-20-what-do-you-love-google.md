**Caution**: The author is going to gloat multiple times about himself and Google. You should not read this if :

1. You hate gloaters/fanboys.
2. You hate Google
3. You hate author

**Introduction**

I first got to use Internet in 8th standard as a summer vacation activity, when I made my first email ID. But I came to learn about [**Google**](http://google.com/) only next year (via a friend) when I used it to print the holiday homework of "Indus Valley Civilization" (technically the cafe-wallah used it, I just saw Google for the first time). I actually used Google for the first time next year when my brother got a dreaded holiday homework.

**Getting Hooked**

As I started to use Internet more and more, the need for a search engine became clearer. At that time I didn't have any preference for Google, so at times I would use Yahoo also for searching purpose, but I quickly realized that searching on Google was faster and search results were cleaner (if not better). When I got a computer at home the next year after that, using Google became second nature on Internet.

At that time I was a happy Yahoo mail user (with a stupid email ID), but had heard about awesome Gmail and knew it was 'invite only'. Being always a 'trier' of new things, I tried to get an invite. But before I could get it, they made Gmail available for all, the next year (are you counting how many 'next years' have happened?). So, I quickly made an account, even more quickly ditched Yahoo id after that. 

After that I started using other Google services slowly and slowly. And today I use at least a dozen Google services (many of them on a daily basis).

**Tried in vain**

In the recent years I have even tried to get out of the Google fever by trying alternate services, but without much success:

1. I ditched [**Gmail**](https://mail.google.com/) for sometime and tried **[LiveMail](http://login.live.com/)** and **[YahooMail](http://mail.yahoo.com/)**. Even desktop clients like **[Thunderbird](http://www.mozilla.org/thunderbird/)** and **[Operamail](http://www.opera.com/)**. While I was impressed by Thunderbird, I gotta say I am now quite used to Gmail and it makes 'dealing with mails' less painful than others (even enjoyable!).

2. Tried to use **[Bing](http://bing.com/)**/[**Yahoo**](http://www.yahoo.com/) for searching purpose, but again too much use of Google before, caused me to return to Google yet again (not to mention, that I simply don't like the current interface of Bing/Yahoo sites).

3. Tried [**Safari**](http://www.apple.com/safari) and Opera instead of **[Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/)**. While I still use Opera from time to time, I am mostly stuck b/w using Chrome and **[Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/fx/)** (no clear winner here).

4. You know [**why** **I don't like Facebook**]({% post_url 2011-06-24-why-i-dont-like-facebook-anyway %}), so I was stuck using [**Orkut**](http://www.orkut.com/) (at one time used to spend hours there) and now recently moved to [**GooglePlus**](http://plus.google.com/)

5. I am an avid blog reader (blog writer?), so I use **[Google Reader](http://reader.google.com/)** to keep tab of the latest posts. I tried using other things like [**Feedly Firefox extension**](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/feedly/) and desktop clients like **[FeedDemon](http://www.feeddemon.com/)** but again Google interface seemed built to do the heavy duty reading. Not to mention they make it super easy to share stuff with friends from there.

6. I started using Google **[Buzz](https://profiles.google.com/googlebuzz/buzz)** and **[Twitter](http://twitter.com/)** almost simultaneously (around the time I got Internet@Home) and am hooked to both of them. Again, there isn't any favorite between 2 slightly similar sites. But Buzz helped me get the most out of social networking in the absence of Orkut.

7. I have recently watched a few videos from **[vimeo](http://vimeo.com/)** and **[blip.tv](http://blip.tv/)** (and **[TED](http://www.ted.com/)**) and I gotta say that they seem to host better and professional quality videos. But no denying the fact that **[YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/)** still rules when it comes to videos. I have recently been hooked to a few of the video series there and can't go without my weekly doses now.

8. Have tried **[Flickr](http://flickr.com/)** (and even use it regularly but mostly to get amazed by the photos there) but I mostly use **[Picasa](https://picasaweb.google.com/)** for storing and sharing photos. Though I should mention that I am really annoyed with their current interface and I believe that it needs a quick and comprehensive overhaul.

9. Have been a recent entrant to Google **[Docs](http://docs.google.com/)** domain so not tried its alternatives till now (though I have heard about **[Microsoft Office Live](http://office.microsoft.com/)** and **[Zoho Office](http://www.zoho.com/)**). While it has its quirks, I found it to be immensely helpful while we made our college projects.

10. I don't see any competition to Google **[Maps](http://maps.google.com/)**, and a few other translation services I have seen (besides Google [**Translate**](http://translate.google.com/)) produced hilarious results at best (not to say that Google's solution is perfect).

11. Have tried **[Calendar](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar)** service from Mozilla but [**Google Calendar**](http://calendar.google.com/) rocks! I have even tried to use [**RTM**](http://www.rememberthemilk.com/) for task management but found it too cumbersome so returned to **[Tasks](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mjbfkceielapenhcdmppjfjfhjelhcjc?hl=en-US)**.

12. And of course, I almost forgot to mention [**Blogger**](http://blogger.com/)! I haven't tried Wordpress much, people say that [**Wordpress**](http://wordpress.org/) is used by professional grade bloggers. Recently, I am trying out [**Tumblr**](http://tumblr.com/) and making a mini blog of sort (not in public domain right now).

And there are a myriad of services that I tried and found them to be great (**[Groups](http://groups.google.com/), [Sites](http://sites.google.com/), [News](http://news.google.com/), [Code](http://code.google.com/)** etc.) but not much useful for me in daily life (at least till now). And there are numerous services I am yet to try out (their umbrella of services is really big!).

While I haven't got my hands on [**ChromeOS**](http://www.chromium.org/chromium-os) and **[Android](http://www.android.com/)**, but the press about them has always been good. So, I am waiting for my first Android and getting to test drive a ChromeBook.

So, now that I have talked about What do I love, it's time to **[explore why?]({% post_url 2011-07-20-what-do-you-love-google %})**
