Today is 9/11 yet again and it will be gross injustice to the **[previous 9/11 post](http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2010/09/911-promises-on-911.html)** if I don't review it today.

  

**1\. Weight 60+ Kgs:** I tried for sometime but then just left it. I feel hopeless in this department. I don't even want to talk about it now. Let's move.

  

**2\. Promises be kept:** In retrospect, I think this was a really vague promise I made. Because there just wasn't any set criteria for what will be considered as a promise, since I seldom use the word "I promise to...". Having said that, I think I did pretty good in the last one year, but still couldn't do a few things I "promised" to do (like meeting after promising!). Promising to keep up the promise all the time is insanely hard. I think it is better to be really careful while making promises.

  

**3\. Don't wait to be late:** This was once again a disaster. I thought I was late even more times in the last one year than any other year. Total fail.

  

**4\. Concentrate to Meditate / Meditate to Concentrate:** Tried out a lot of techniques of meditation, including guided meditation, meditation while lying down or walking, meditation while running or even while doing a task. And did get partial success. But still a proper 15-20 mins of meditation everyday is not in my success resume right now.

  

**5\. Either be one or forget it:** I started revising my programming skills about 3 months back and have been doing regular (though not extreme) programming everyday for last 30 days or so. Not a success yet, but I think I have just made a good start.

  

**6\. buzzRSH > 50 posts:** Now this is prime reason that I am writing this review :) [**Full success!**](http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2011/09/anosm-blog-story-after-one-year.html) (though it came dangerously close to being another failure.

  

**7\. It's a funny issue:** I think I have done some good progress in this department (though friends will be able to tell better). I have moved on from the sad & painful period, and while set backs still come in life, I think I am getting better at handling them. What's amusing is that some of the issues that were causing discomfort turned out to be a non-issue later on! So, it's funny to say but I am happy :) Don't believe me? **[Read this!](http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2011/07/bhains-ki-post.html)**

  

**8\. Learn/Do something new:** I started **[learning GIMP](http://thinkxp.blogspot.com/2011/08/digital-art-day.html)** sometime ago and I made some good progress in that department. I also shared my progress (secretly!) with a selective few friends. I have also been trying to learn to sleep early and I am proud to say that for about 1 month I slept on or before 9.30 pm and around 10 pm for the past 2 months! Unfortunately, the Anna movement has disrupted the schedule and now will have to build it all over again. But now, I know I can sleep early!

  

**9\. Stop being afraid:** Again it was a bit vague promise. I think I meant to say as to take far more initiatives, which, I did I would argue. So it was a fairly successful promise.

  

I made 2 more promises more for others (read family/friends) than for me (and also because 9 + 2 = 11 :)Â 

  

**10\. Get (a) mobile:** I tried mates, but like a girlfriend, I think **[mobiles are not made for me](http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2010/08/why-i-dont-have-mobile.html)** (or the other way around?). The thing is that I really don't feel a need to keep mobiles, they just irritate me. I don't think, I will "never" get a mobile. But when exactly, I can't and won't promise (again). But to compensate for that I did something else "just for friends" (you know what I mean ;)

  

**11\. Get employed:** I did complete this promise and though I could have done a better (or say smarter) job while getting a job, I am content with what I achieved, for now.

  

As I said when I started, I wasn't sure of completing even one of these. But I did do a few of them and I am proud of the fact. But, I also found out that I kept slacking initially and the real efforts came only in the last 3 months or so. So, I think instead of giving a list of virtually a new year resolutions, it's better to make just ONE promise and try and complete that before making another.

  

With that in mind, I will try and learn meditation now and get regular in this skill by the end of this year.
