Enough girl, I have had enough,  
I just can't take it anymore,  
I gave you chances, not once but twice,  
Now you don't deserve a third and forth.

Hey I never asked you to love me,  
Heck if I deserve it, I ain't sure,  
All I wanted was be respected a li'l,  
But you behaved as if I was obscure,

I tried my best not to hurt you,  
Doesn't matter if I got hurt doing so,  
But you treated me like a dirt-bag,  
A commodity to pick, use 'n throw,

Yes I liked you, I still do,  
It was Love or what, I don't know,  
I cared for you more than anything else.  
May be that's why you took me for sure.

You broke my heart, I remained silent,   
Got trashed, didn't speak a single word,  
You insulted me, dented my confidence,  
I still kept you first, my thoughts immured,

But everything in life, good or bad, comes to an end,   
No miss, I ain't taking it, the way I used to take before,  
I can't be your toy to play & throw & break,  
A new one you will now have to procure,

The beaker of tolerance is overflowing now,  
At any point of time this volcano can erupt,  
I just hope you go away, far far away from me,  
Because I still don't want you to get hurt.
