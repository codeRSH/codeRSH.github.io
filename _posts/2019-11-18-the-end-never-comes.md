...Or let's say, it comes only when it's The End.

Since childhood we have been sold this lie that you do this or that, and the life will be gravy afterwards. 

"Complete 10th, take science and it's done." 

"Complete School, get great marks, it will be great afterwards."

"Clear Engineering Entrance and get into a good college, and then you are all set."

"Complete college with respectable marks, finally clear job interview, and life will be fine."

"Now work hard to get promoted to senior level."

"Become a manager and life will be smooth afterwards."


Initially our parents sell this lie to us, then the peers, the society, our boss. Ultimately, we start telling this lie to ourselves, actually believing it to be the truth. That you are just one step away from bliss, from Nirvana, from happily ever after. Except that last step never comes. 

Well, after 31 years, I have understood that you are never finished. You are always in the process. The end of one thing marks the beginning of next. First you need a job, then you need a better paying job, then you need a better status, then you need a car, a bigger car, a house of your own, multiple properties, stocks... Until you die. 

So, if it's a never ending process do we even need to indulge in it? Why not just make ends meet, earn a few bucks and then enjoy your life watching Netflix (or what that you like)? That's one way of living for sure, but life worth living is what brings fulfillment. 

If watching Netflix brings fulfillment to you, sure go ahead and spend hours on it. But more often than not it will be an escape to something else which might bring real fulfillment to your life. If achieving great and higher things (money, status, fame et el.) bring fulfillment then sure indulge in the rat race. 

The problem is never this rat race. The race is fine as long as you know why we are running and are happy to be its part. The problem comes when we don't realize that this rat race never ends. There will always be a rat bigger, stronger and faster than you. It will then bring discontent and hence you will run faster, exhausting yourself or taking paths that you never intended to take in the first place. 

So my advice to myself: Continue doing whatever you are doing with your life. But sometimes, just take a pause and remind yourself that life is passing by. So enjoy the process of achieving something rather than the goal itself. The end never comes. Or let's say it comes when it's The End.
