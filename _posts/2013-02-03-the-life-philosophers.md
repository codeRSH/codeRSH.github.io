In yet **[another attempt]({% post_url 2013-01-27-ethics-absolute-or-relative %})** to crowd-source views on a common topic, I asked people (known to me):  
  

_"What philosophy/rule that you follow to live your life? Is there any idea at the core of your way of living"._ 

  

And **[as always]({% post_url 2011-08-02-superstitious-views %})**, I got some really interesting (and not so interesting!) views. This time I have kept the contributions anonymous (as far as possible), to make it more interesting. I have presented them (almost) unedited so as to show what people think about their life. Thank you all who contributed. It of course, wasn't possible without you. Indulge!

_"Waqt se pehle taqdeer se jada kabhi kuch ni milta..._

_But waqt or takdeer dono badle ja skte hain if u have it!_

_My funda of life"_

_"My reason to be alive is to live. . Dreams, aims ambitions, sacrifice, dnt excite me, my ultimate goal is to live"_

_"Mine is " i hv a class to maintain" i keep telling myself this whn nyone does does nything low/ ethically wrong/ with me, i feel like responding in tht same manner ( which i knw, i m capable of) but i cant stoop to their level n keep reminding my self of "i hv a class to maintain" this stops me from taking revenge many at times n keeps my morals in check. Its like " mujmein n doosron mein kya farak hain?". "class ka farak hain""_

_"THERE IS NOTHING STATIC IN THIS WORLD._

_That's what I hav learnt from my life._

_Everythng will change one day..._

_Wheather its climate or the situtions._

_Itwill definately change one day.._

_So we need to create our own ethtics to tackle those circumstances._

_After the things we do reflects how much capable weare in the test of life."_

_"one of them whch always inspires me n even changes my way of thnkng over life, can say motivates me when i got depressed is_

_" zndgi mohtaz nahi manjilonki , waqt har manjil dikha deta h, koi marta nahi kisi k bichhadne se, waqt sbko jeena sikha deta h.""_

_"There are actually lots of them! One of them which immediately came into my mind after reading the quote you mentioned goes like:_ 

_"Good things usually happen, bad things sometimes happen"_ 

_\- Dr. House (Episode-Nobody's Fault)"_

_"my personal favourite is dont worry, take it easy, be happy, god bless u"_

_"Necessity is the mother of invention"_

_"Life is beautiful when we make it beautiful,its all depends upon us.so make life beautiful......"_

_"'Average' is my philosophy....everything is average (neither good nor bad)"_

_"Heaven and hell are two things.its depends upon you what you want....make life like heaven."_

_"Philosophy/Rule : Work hard,leave past, live in present & wait for d future._

_Quote/Saying : To become old and intelligent, you need to be young and stupid_

_Idea(Way of living) : I will make the REST of my LIFE, the BEST of my LIFE.__"_

_" Life is not fair. Just know that and deal with it. Things are messed up. People are messed up. Nothing is perfect. But what's there to live in a Utopia either? For all I know for now is that I would be frustrated after a few days (months tops) if my life becomes "perfect". It is the challenges, a hunt for something, search for answers that makes life worthwhile for me. I am Prashant Khajotia and this is my philosophy. "_

_"i do what i want to do in a particular situation, and i dnt bother what others are doing regarding the same thing"_

_"Philosophy/rule : well i live for all that all what happen in your life is all for ur own good ...._ 

_Quote/Saying : that all your hardship and hard work in your past will make your future good, caring and happy !!!_   
_Idea : Be good and hlpful to ur loved one nd work hard.. u will surely get a n njoyable life !!"_  
_"dont run here and there like a mouse. Make sure you bell the CAT before you die."_  
_"Love (of bf/gf type) is the most selfish feeling in this world..... thats why stay away from it..... flirting is quite genereous on other hand....."_  
_"Every minute, every second, everything in between those seconds, i only think and dream about you. Whatever i do, it is with the thought of our beautiful future that I wish we will one day share together. Before I met you, I never thought I could be with one person. Now, i can't think of being without the one person, that is you."_  
_"Well my take is simple Ravi, be loyal to your friends and family and play fair if possible and foul if necessary."_
