<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
<span style="font-family: inherit; text-align: justify;"><b>A Very Brief History</b></span><br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;">The exact origins of the word/phrase "Gootle" is unknown. But Gootle became popular in Southern Deccan region sometime at the fag end of 2011. It is still a highly localized word but due to the power of social networking and enthusiastic users of the phrase, it is catching on with the masses.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><b>Gootle: Defined</b></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;">A Gootle (Hindi: गूटले) refers to a highly&nbsp;</span>specialized<span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;person who *must* have all the following characteristics:</span><br />
<ol>
<li><span style="font-family: inherit;">First and foremost, he must be proud to be a Gootle.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: inherit;">He must respect all the fellow Gootles.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: inherit;">All Gootles are the same, irrespective of the caste, creed, color, language, height, weight, biceps, triceps, abs etc. Hence, a Gootle must refer to his fellow Gootle as a "Gootle" only and nothing else (no first names allowed).</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: inherit;">A Gootle must protect his peer Gootles from others, especially the non-gootles.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: inherit;">A Gootle must automatically and magically develop all the other characteristics required, as and when the stated definition of Gootle changes.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;">As can be gauged from the above rules, "Gootle" is basically a masculine word. But it doesn't mean that only males can become a Gootle. While there hasn't yet been a single instance of a female identifying herself as a Gootle, but gauging by the rapid popularity of the term, it's estimated that this gender barrier will be broken soon. It has been agreed in the Gootle community to call a "female Gootle" as "Gootlee" (Hindi: गूटली) and be given the same rights as a male Gootle.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span>
<b>Everything (else) you wanted to know about Gootle</b></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;">While it may seem that to be called a Gootle, a person has to be a born Gootle, it's not exactly true. A person can develop traits of a Gootle with constant practice, hard work and descipline. And once you start getting identified as a Gootle, it also doesn't gaurantee that you will remain a Gootle your whole life. You have to keep the same level of dedication and have to keep earning the right to be called a Gootle.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;">It should also be noted that while everyone can become a Gootle, not just "anyone" can become a Gootle. Some people who present themselves proudly as Gootles are in fact not at all a Gootle, because a true Gootle never brags himself. And some people spend their entire life without coming to know that they were in fact Gootles, and hence were way more awesome than they thought themselves to be.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span>
<b>Myth Busted!</b></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;">There is a popular misconception among people (especially among ignorant souls and those non-gootles who are jealous of real Gootles) that "Gootle" is a derogatory term. But a true Gootle will testify that being called a Gootle&nbsp;</span>especially<span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;by fellow Gootles is one of the proudest things that could have ever happened to him. In fact, even "Google" thinks that it's a "<b><a href="https://www.google.co.in/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=Gootle#hl=en&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=gootle&amp;oq=gootle&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g-s4&amp;aql=&amp;gs_l=serp.3..0i10l4.7295l10161l0l10426l11l6l3l0l0l0l1892l3997l0j4j7-1j1l11l0.frgbld.&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.,cf.osb&amp;fp=ed1d85aac4a9b36c&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=681">Gootle</a></b>"!</span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span>
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><b>How to become a Gootle?</b></span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit;">So, if you also want to become a Gootle, all you have to do is to make use of the power of positive imagination. Imagine yourself to be Gootle all the time, behave like one, study other Gootles, emulate their styles, take tips from them and within no time you will become a Gootle yourself. Goot leck!</span></div>
