I had originally planned to continue this streak till end of the year, breaking my own record on this blog. However, I have decided to take a (hopefully small) break from the streak. I haven't been writing to my liking since past few days. I know it's not easy every day to write fluently, but it shouldn't feel like a chore either. Writing should come from the heart.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Secondly, writing on a daily basis also makes it a chore for your reader too, if they don't really get that much time to read. So, hopefully spacing out the blogs will be better for both me and you.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
I started this streak to prove to myself that I still have it in me to write on a regular basis. I will say that I have been fairly successful in that goal. I completed <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-11-12-post-200 %}">3 milestones</a> on <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-11-22-crossing-400-out-of-1000sher %}">each</a> of the <a href="https://medium.com/@medmRSH/50th-post-5aa9426fff5f">3 blogs</a> in these 30 days. That's been the biggest highlight of this streak, for me.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
However, I want to write something meaningful that I myself can enjoy reading sometime in future. I feel some of the past few posts haven't lived up to that mark.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
As I wrote at the start of the month, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-11-04-i-want-to-be-fiction-writer %}">I want to write fiction</a>. So I will probably try to write a couple of stories in the month of December. No promises, but that's definitely something to try. Most of my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-11-27-11th-floor-fiction %}">stories </a>have been based on a vague idea, on which I have just developed the scene as I kept writing. But this time I will try to build a different approach. Probably bring more than 2-3 characters to develop a little more complex story-line, and write the structure before filling the details. That's already making me uncomfortable, so wish me luck.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Participating and successfully completely <a href="https://www.nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo </a>is in my bucket list for a very long time. I have even started it a couple of times, but didn't quite complete it. Well, predictably this November also went unsuccessfully. It's been a successful month for me as a blogger but not as a fiction writer. I hope I get to be successful next year.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
As for general blogging that will continue. I have a quite a few topics to write upon but this time I want to take my own time to write, so that real essence of my thoughts can be brought out.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<b>PS : </b>It would also be great if you tell me directly if you want me to write on a particular topic.&nbsp;</div>
