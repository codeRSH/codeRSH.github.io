A friend of mine is calling me since last 3-4 days and I haven't been able to return his call. I have been meaning to but since it's usually long conversation with him, so I try to find a relatively big chunk of time (say 30 mins or so) to call him back.

It's no surprise that I haven't been able to find that time since last 3 days. Take today for instance : I went to doctor in the morning (a little unwell due to cold), then starting receiving calls from hospital, came back home did some office work, then went to a friend's function, then to market, then came back and again did office work. Multiple mails, calls, whatsapp messages, talk with relatives... Blah blah blah!

All the days aren't exactly like that, but they usually follow a similar theme. Sometimes life feels like we are following what's in front of us. Just going through the motions like leaves on a river. Instead of deciding a few tasks per day that would help us progress in life, and then deliberately working on them with full attention and devotion.

And like so many other things, I am sure I am not alone in having this life style. A lot of people (including probably you who is reading this) have a similar problem. Just too busy to do anything out of own will, but not doing anything worth while either.

Most of our days go in doing routine tasks. Going to office, preparing food, washing clothes, taking care of errands, PTM meetings if you are a parent etc. Even going to movie or vacations etc. becomes part of the routine. Where is the big chunk of time to just enjoy a good conversation with a friend, or probably paint, or learn an instrument or whatever you like.

If a particular segment of society has this problem, then it might be understandable. But it looks like each and everyone I know is going through the motions, just being busy, busy busy. Completing one task and then the next and then the next, until she is exhausted, burnt out or dead. Of course, at the other end of spectrum, there are people who have such much of free time that they have to indulge in some kind of addiction to cope with it!

I don't know have a solution or quick fix for this situation (otherwise I would have already self-fixed myself). But what I can definitely say is that's it's not a good situation to be in. Everyone's circumstances are different, but it's worth reflecting upon your business sometimes.

We can't get away from our obligations. Family, friends, work everything is important. But we can at least pause and think if the task at hand is worth doing? Can we not skip it or delegate it or pay someone else to do it?Â 

Being Busy is considered a badge of honor. But being busy doing insignificant things is a big waste of our time and potential.

**PS : @XP** I will call you tomorrow. Till then enjoy yourself.
