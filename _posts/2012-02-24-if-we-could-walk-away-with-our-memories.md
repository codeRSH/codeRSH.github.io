How could you leave me alone.  
How could you do that to me?  
I know you wanted to move ahead in your life,  
But wasn't I meant to be a big part of it?

How do you think will I survive,  
For you have become the air I breath, the food I eat,  
Sans you life will feel less,  
more or less, it will be lifeless.

Deep down I knew the day would come,  
But the urgency of it, I didn't know.  
How life changes in a matter of seconds,  
I don't have a better proof to show.

You knew I won't be able to stop you from going,  
You knew I won't be able to change your mind,  
You used my selflessness, my love, my longing,  
How selfish are you, my friend.

I know it will be lies alright,  
If you say I'll be back for you,  
But can you still say that just once,  
I just want something to cling on to.

Sometimes, I feel how good the life would be,  
If we could walk away with our memories...
