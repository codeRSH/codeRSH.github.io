To you \*RavS\* and \*Ravi\* might be one and the same, or the names might even not matter. But for me, RavS and Ravi seem to be 2 completely different personalities. It's like I have dual nature and I don't know which one is correct or better than the other. So, to get a clearer view, I asked myself the question...Â 

**Differentiate b/w Ravi and RavS**

- Ravi is a reality, and practicality.

- RavS is a concept. An ideology.

- Ravi is God made (through parents :)

- RavS is self made (with some help from friends)

- Ravi believes in hard work and dedication.

- RavS is lazy but believes in smart work and shrewdness.

- Ravi is a Hindi word that means 'Sun'

- RavS can have different meanings in different contexts. But basically RavS is an amalgam of words Ravi + Singh.

- Ravi's full name is Ravi Singh

- RavS uses RavS RSH for full name (RSH being used as a trademark nickname and in Alt names like @twitRSH).

- Ravi is shy by nature and needs to be pushed get work done.

- RavS is ready to take initiative and can push others when the need arises.

- Ravi likes to play safe.

- RavS is far more adventurous and is ready to take risks if the stakes are high.

- Ravi is not very talkative and keeps the conversation to the point.

- RavS is fun to be with, so people like his company.

- Ravi is confident in his abilities and works within his limitations.

- RavS feels insecure and is always looking to improve.

- Ravi is inclusive, officially and unofficially, so he is answerable to every deed.

- RavS is exclusive, and underground.

- Ravi is omnipresent, off and on line.

- RavS is mostly an Internet alter ego.

- Ravi is simple, fair and humble.

- RavS plays with attitude and believes in "ends being more important than means".

- Ravi does not want a girl friend.

- RavS does not have a girl friend.

- Ravi has matured and is ready to take responsibilities (umm.. I guess :).

- RavS is still not fully defined and is evolving day by day.
