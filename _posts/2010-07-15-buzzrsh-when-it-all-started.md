This may just turn out to be interesting....

Hi, my name is RavS and I am here as a (mini) Blogger.

For God knows when, I have been thinking about turning a Blogger. And over time I have been asked by some of my friends also to share my views.

But even after having this deep interest in blogging I have not been able to start my own blog because of a number of reason:

1. **Lack of time**: I don't think one should start a blog if you can't commit to it.
2. **Desire to write long posts**: I have always thought a good blog post should be comprehensive. But then that again requires time and effort. And also, now I think a quality post need not be long but precise and interesting.
3. **Lack of quality topics**: I can't blabber about just anything under the sun. There has to be something that I feel connected to.

So I thought if I can't be a full fledged blogger then why not be a mini Blogger. And Buzz fits the bill once again for that. Who knows if I can develop a discipline of writing here I may one day actually turn a blogger.

So.. in this thread I will write my thoughts. I don't know what I will be blogging about. But I can assure you a few things.

1. The posts will be consistent. At least one per week.
2. They won't contain anything about me that is obvious or known to everybody.
3. They will **usually** be relatively short. (Nobody has time to read tonnes of text.)
4. They will only contain stuffs that are related to my life somehow or things which I genuinely feel about.
5. ~~They will also act like diary logs.~~

**Notes:**

Since this will be acting as a place for me to blog, I have to disable comments. Sorry, if you don't like it. If you have anything to say, you can always mail me.

I am not writing here to show how cool I am but to develop a sense of discipline to write and to give words to my thoughts.

I don't intend to popularize this thread, so I have made this thread viewable to only 8 persons (my top 8 friends according to latest rankings!). And if you can read this thread, you are one of them!! Just don't tell anyone.

Reading this thread is completely optional for you. I don't force you but I will appreciate if you can give 5 mins to thread per week.
