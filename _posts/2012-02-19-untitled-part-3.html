<span style="font-size: large;"><b><a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2012/02/untitled-part-2.html">[Previous Part]</a></b></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-size: x-large;">Reaching the front</span><span style="font-size: large;">&nbsp;end of the bus was nothing short of an adventure in itself. If anyone ever wanted to <span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-size: large;">research</span> on</span></span> how much flexible a human body can be, then they should try travelling in one of these Indian buses. But I have had plenty of such experiences <b><a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2011/09/10.html">travelling in Delhi buses</a></b>, that I managed to do the impossible. After nudging the elbows, knees and feet of about 2 dozen men and women I somehow reached my 'destination' (destiny?).&nbsp;</span></div>
<br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-size: large;">On any other day, I would have whined about how overcrowded Indian buses are or how overcrowded India itself is, or moaned about how easy it is for women to travel in buses with <b><a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2011/03/that-elusive-bus-seat.html">seats always reserved</a></b> for them. More so in this city where I found that seats are reserved for women not on one but both sides of the bus! But not today. Today my mind was busy with something more useful!</span></div>
<br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-size: large;">I positioned myself in such a way so as to get a full glance of my... err... reason-to-be-in-the-bus. I had to push the 'uncle' on my right, a little, so as to occupy the premium view. He had this displeased look on his face, but today was not the day to care about normal people.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-size: large;">And there she was! Still anxious, still silent, still beautiful... <span style="font-size: large;">A</span> warm smile spread all over my face. I really didn't have words to describe how good it felt seeing her.&nbsp;I was also a little worried she may&nbsp;recognize&nbsp;me and get suspicious. But her continued nervous expression reassured me that she was too busy in her thoughts to notice her silent admirer of last 37 minutes.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span>
<span style="font-size: large;">Her big round chunky eyes were looking out of the window, hair flowing back, black dupatta was sitting pretty on the right side of half sleeved black kurti and chhudidaars, a reddish orange thread on the left wrist, a kangan and watch on the right one, deep brown colored handbag over the lap, a phone in the right hand, a little black bindi on the forehead and a gold nose ring completed the look.</span></div>
<br />
<span style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;">I really wanted to take a picture of my... , from my phone cam. But didn't have the courage to take one in front of everyone, and didn't have the skills to do it&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;">discreetly</span><span style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;">. Damn it!</span><br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-size: large;">So, I tried to memorize all the features of her round little face: the lips, the chin, the cheeks, the earlobes, the eyebrows, the eyelashes. I couldn't help but notice that beside a little eyeliner, she wasn't wearing any makeup. Probably, she also agreed with me that any artificial make-up harms the natural scenery. Ahh.. If only other girls agreed with us.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<div>
<span style="font-size: large;">Suddenly, I realized that the phone in my pocket had been vibrating for sometime now. As I reached to take up the call, I knew who would be calling me at this time...</span><br />
