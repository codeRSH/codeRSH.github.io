Chronic Procrastination. That's the word. Waiting for the right time to come, to do something worthwhile.

Doing a grand "Go Live" of the new domain. Creating your own Channel and surprising everyone. Basically day dreaming of becoming a Hero without doing the work necessary for it.

But at what cost? Forever waiting to start something and just losing time all this while? Is being a hero worth so much lost time? "Good Enough" may not be perfect, but it isn't mediocre either. We can only achieve greatness if we start, however shitty it may be. 

Why can't we -rather I- be a normal human being? Accept oursevles as another creature out of billions just trying to survive and make sense of this world? Why do we have to mandatorily be a Hero and not a person in progress? Can a normal person not be a Hero just doing normal things expected out of him ?

 As Steven Pressfield says it's a form of Resistance which is out there to 'kill' us and rob us of our true potential. This Procrastination and unnecessary longing for Perfection got to stop at some point.

There is no 'Right Time' except Now. Stop Waiting. Start Doing.
