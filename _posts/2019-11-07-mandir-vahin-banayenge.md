If you live in India and haven't been living in a borewell, then you would know that the verdict on Ram-Mandir/Babri Masjid case will probably come on or before 17 November. Like me you might have also been reading and watching news about how the Govt and the various religious organizations are preparing themselves for the verdict, appealing for peace and appealing for maintaining communal harmony, and how the people of Ayodhya are on their toes, some even leaving their homes, fearing the worse.

This is a very dangerous topic to comment on in public, but I will take my chances. Speaking your mind, even if you are wrong or not with the popular view is very important. And like me you are also entitled for your own opinion and are free to express it, preferably in the comment section. But first hear me out. 

First of all I consider myself an agnostic, and am not an overtly religious kind. I don't muddle with anyone's religious practices and prefer not to comment on it either, because religion is a very private thing. I believe no should come between you and your God, or tell you how you should maintain relationship with your God. 

My only problem lies when someone is forced to participate in any religious procession when they are not inclined to, or if public gets inconvenience due to some else's religious practices. Playing loudspeakers on inhumanly hours for Azaans and Jagrans , the rowdiness of Kanwars etc. are a few good examples of it. So, now when I make a comment on this case, you probably have an idea from where I am coming from.

Here are some of my thougths...

Ram is one of our Hindu Gods and quite popular in Northern India. But I don't think any other God's name has been misused more than Ram. "Ram" is used to get votes, "Ram" is used to incite mob mentality. "Ram" is used to even start riots and justify violence and murder etc. Just have a look into [this series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLx9w4BXh1KvVoIQdI3zcT50PvbCPlMgO7) and this [documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMT18TMNQbY), which I believe have been made very objectively. If these videos don't show the full side of the picture, please do provide me with other facts. I am always willing to change my mind when presented with new facts and ideas.

But for now, based on above videos, let's be clear that Ram Janmbhoomi is a matter of faith, and has no historical proof (The ASI report only tells there was a Hindu Temple or a structure similar to it, but no evidence on which God ). Where exactly Ram as a human was born, no one can tell. Heck, most of us can't tell exactly where we were born ( in which bed of which room of which hospital?) .  So, if this piece of land has to be given for building a Ram Temple, it would be only to pander the sentiments of the Majority Hindu group. Those same sentiments which have been cleverly and consistently stoked by certain religious organizations for their own gains and purposes.  If Ram Temple was such a big issue, it should have been on national imagination from the starting and not from the late 80s when the infamous Rath Yatras were organized.

I accept Mughals were cruel. I accept they would have done numerous atrocities on the people of that time. I agree numerous temples have been broken under there watch (but no one knows how many). But does this justify hating today's Muslims calling them the descendants of those Muslim Rulers of past? Is it required to break down the structures of those times to ensure we get "justice" ? Well if we do have to do it, then  Britishers didn't do any less atrocities on us and looted our wealth too (Mughals at least didn't take it away). So, why don't we start hating all the historical structures of British period also, let's start with boycotting English language itself!

Let's for a moment consider there really was a Ram Temple there. But still the acts of installing the Ram Idols by breaking locks or pulling down Babri Masjid etc. both against the orders of court, does it really heed well for us as a society or Hindu Culture?  Even after over 25 years of breaking the Babri Masjid no one has been able to make a Temple there and we have to wait for court order only.  Even today's Modi Govt. always mentioning the Ram Temple its manifesto always says let's wait for court order. If we ultimately had turn to courts only for final order then why do contempt of their orders in the first place?

A note to the Muslim community leaders too, especially the ones fighting this case in court. I heard some rumors of an out of court settlement too. I agree bringing down Babri Masjid was a crime and everyone involved in it should get appropriate punishment. But wasn't there any chances of you guys softening your position over these years? Was Babri Masjid even more important than the lives of fellow Hindus and Muslims who have been killed brutally in multiple riots? From the way sentiments have been flamed, I am sure this issue won't stop even if Court gives final verdict in Muslim side favor. I can clearly see that, but why can't you? Yes, it requires sacrifice from your side, but bringing long lasting peace by resolving this issue isn't worth it? If you are afraid this will give impetus to Mandir demands at other places, then why don't you resolve all such issues together, probably asking for Masjid protection at other places in lieu of giving up this title. Yes, you can say that why only Muslims have to make sacrifice, but sometimes we also need to be practical about situations. 

I personally don't care if Ram Temple doesn't get built there (agnostic remember). But if it does get built, it would definitely be huge relief for me. At least we Indians will get over our fixation of this issue and hopefully start caring about more pressing issues like our poverty, climate change, pollution, water scarcity, abysmal infrastructure, poor education, malnutrition, lack of jobs and opportunities etc. Ultimately whatever verdict comes out in this case, I also hope all these religious organizations and Govt etc. actually respect the verdict and even if it needs challenging, it be done within constitutional framework. 

We are going through a delicate phase with the economy being "khatre me" and lots of unemployed frustrated youth waiting for an opportunity to vent out their anger somehow. I hope Lord Ram blesses us with a better senses and cooler heads. More than Ram Temple we need Ram in our temple. Jai Shri Ram!!
