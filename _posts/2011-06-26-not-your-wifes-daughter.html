<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
<div style="font-family: inherit; margin: 0px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"><i>“A  newly-born baby girl was found abandoned behind the Ram temple near a  garbage depot in Dehu Road on Saturday around 7 am.....”</i></span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit; margin: 0px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit; margin: 0px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">This is the news I read today in<a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/Newly-born-girl-found-abandoned/articleshow/8994054.cms"> TOI</a>  newspaper. And I was really-really disturbed after reading that  gruesome news, thinking about that tiny little heart, and wondering what  could she possibly do in less than 24 hours that her parents decided to  just leave her to rot in garbage. I am filled with pain for that little  girl who isn’t even aware of where in the world she is. And there is  furious rage for those uncaring and soulless bastards who had the heart  to just dump their little daughter, literally like a piece of trash,  letting her die a slow and painful death.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit; margin: 0px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit; margin: 0px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">Sadly  this is not the first time I am hearing this kind of story. I have  heard and read about several such instances, where girls are choked to  death, buried alive, burned, given sedatives, thrown in burning oil and  what not.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit; margin: 0px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit; margin: 0px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">I  was left wondering how can someone do such a thing their own child. I  could only think of these 3 reasons (would like to know if you have any  other theory):</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit; margin: 0px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit; margin: 0px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">1.  She was an ‘illicit’ child (like the above report suspects) who would  never get accepted by our so called “Indian” society with its “moral  culture”; so she was conveniently thrown away. But an abortion would  have been even more convenient; unless the parents just wanted to enjoy  the pregnancy phase and then kill their child in the name of “honor”.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit; margin: 0px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit; margin: 0px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">2.  Her parents were so poor that they couldn’t afford to feed her 3 times a  day. Well then if you can’t afford to raise a child, go get those free  condoms that govt. distributes. Can’t you afford those also?</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit; margin: 0px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit; margin: 0px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">3.  The child was a GIRL. I presume most likely that was her ‘fault’. That  she was not yet another male in this male dominated society.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit; margin: 0px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit; margin: 0px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">I  don’t give a shit, what those so called women oriented TV serials and  films try to portray. To me they seem more drama and less reality. They  seem to be actually glorifying these kinds of events and such people  should be sent behind bars. </span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit; margin: 0px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit; margin: 0px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">But  when I hear and read about such sinful acts in real life, I really  worry if we are really progressing as a nation? We say that we are way  better than Pakistan, Afghanistan and other such countries where women  are still treated as slaves to men. But when the same mentality and  partiality is seen in here, I don’t find our great nation to be that  great. These are some moments I don’t feel that proud to be an Indian.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit; margin: 0px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit; margin: 0px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"><i>“But not everybody is like that.”</i>...  Yeah, that’s right probably. And we should be thankful, these people  who let their girl child live! But is it any good? They still impose  their choices about the clothes to wear, people to talk to, places  allowed to go. She is still treated 2nd rated to her male sibling, still  not given all the facilities provided to a son. She won’t probably go  to the same school, she won’t get the same kind of fancy clothes to  wear, she will be expected to do the house hold chores (like a servant)  and get scolded/beaten mercilessly for not “obeying orders”.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit; margin: 0px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit; margin: 0px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"><i>“But that usually happens in rural areas”</i>....  Really? Because I live in a metro, and I see that happening all the  time in my own neighborhood. The above mentioned incident happened in a  city. And according to the <a href="http://censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/India_at_glance/fsex.aspx">latest census</a>, the sex ratio of urban areas is way lower than rural areas. Still think it's a rural phenomenon?</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit; margin: 0px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit; margin: 0px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"><i>“So, what’s the solution, you suggest”</i>...  I honestly have no clue. I am not writing this as an article to get  marks in some kind of competition or test, where I will give magic  suggestions and everything will be OK. I honestly feel disgusted and  shamed by such acts. And things won’t change until this society’s bias  towards a girl child doesn't change. </span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit; margin: 0px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit; margin: 0px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">I  frankly laugh at us Indians’ hunger for a son; one who can take their  clan/family legacy forward, who can help the father in his business...  my ass. I have seen instances in real life where the parents will go on  conceiving 3-4 times, in the hope that they at last get a son.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit; margin: 0px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit; margin: 0px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">A  daughter is the greatest gift someone can receive. I have always  believed that girls are stronger and better than boys in so many areas.  Everybody deserves a fair chance. Nobody should suffer because of their  gender.</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit; margin: 0px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="font-family: inherit; margin: 0px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">And  yes, I just so wish that the butcher parents of that child die the same  painful death they chose to give their little daughter.</span></div>
