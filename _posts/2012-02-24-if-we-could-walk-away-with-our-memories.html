<span style="font-size: large;">How could you leave me alone.<br />How could you do that to me?<br />I know you wanted to move ahead in your life,<br />But wasn't I meant to be a big part of it?<br /><br />How do you think will I survive,<br />For you have become the air I breath, the food I eat,<br />Sans you life will feel less, <br />more or less, it will be lifeless.<br /><br />Deep down I knew the day would come,<br />But the urgency of it, I didn't know.<br />How life changes in a matter of seconds,<br />I don't have a better proof to show.<br /><br />You knew I won't be able to stop you from going,<br />You knew I won't be able to change your mind,<br />You used my selflessness, my love, my longing,<br />How selfish are you, my friend.<br /><br />I know it will be lies alright,<br />If you say I'll be back for you,<br />But can you still say that just once,<br />I just want something to cling on to. <br /><br />Sometimes, I feel how good the life would be,<br />If we could walk away with our memories...</span><br />
