<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
This year is as good as over. This also brings a lot of 'regrets' like past many years. Things that could have been better, stuffs that I could have done, habits that I could have created, skills that I could have learned and all. I am also aware that I am not alone sulking with this kind of thinking at this time of year.<br />
<br />
So instead, I thought to concentrate on the positives that came of this year (and even though it's a little difficult to digest, but for every person, every year brings with it some positives). I enumerate them not to gloat how awesome I am (I already know that!), but in the hope that it will inspire me to achieve more next year (I am betting 2014 to be the best &nbsp;year of my life yet), and also inspire anyone reading this to think what good this year brought to their lives.<br />
<br />
<b>1. <a href="https://medium.com/running/1c49f0b8b92e">Realized the dream of running a half marathon</a>:</b> No goal that is achieved, is achieved the way it was conceived to be achieved. But nevertheless, I bit the bullet, put in the hard work and achieved it. The number of 2:54 hours might not be impressive enough but it does give me a lot of confidence that I can set my sight on numerous other goals and convert them from dream to reality.<br />

<b>2. <a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2012/02/if-we-could-walk-away-with-our-memories.html">Started composing poems in English</a></b><a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2012/02/if-we-could-walk-away-with-our-memories.html">:</a> &nbsp;When I started writing poems 2 years ago I <b><a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2011/12/blog-post.html">wrote mostly in Hindi</a></b>. But, this year especially in the second half, I wrote almost exclusively in English (along with&nbsp;one in <b><a href="http://1000sher.tumblr.com/post/64368271855">Punjabi</a></b>!) and that gives me a lot of confidence. This year took me past 100 poems and hence the dream of <b><a href="http://1000sher.tumblr.com/">writing 1000 compositions</a></b> continues to live. I understand that whatever I write is nowhere near professional, but I can testify that there has always been at least one person (not always the same) who has genuinely appreciated every single thing that I wrote this year. A few people also didn't hesitate to tell the same compositions as 'not up to the mark' or 'bad'. You guys are my creative fuel, thanks again.<br />
<br />
<b>3. Became a better professional:</b> When I started the year, I was in a sad position of being just a rookie - a 'fresher' as a lot of people like to call. Not being confident of my own abilities (due to lack of opportunities to prove myself - to myself). There came even a point where I seriously considered quitting and trying something else. Now as I end this year, I am amply more confident. I have started to feel that whatever problems come, I have the ability to solve it, sooner or later. And this is extremely important not just in my line of work, but the life in general.<br />
<br />
<b>4. Made new friends:</b> This one should probably have been at the top. I feel that finding people whom you won't mind talking even after 2-3 decades from now, is extremely important and I think I found at least 2 such people this year. I also strengthened the bond with the existing ones although a few left the vicinity. It was quite a fruitful year in that respect.<br />
<br />
<b>5. Reached the 60 Kg mark:</b> This might sound funny, except it's not. Some people are hard loser, I have been a real hard gainer. I didn't gain (or lose) a pound for almost 5 years. So, the fact that I reached 60 Kg for the first time in my life is a big deal. Currently at 61, sights firmly set on the 70 mark now.<br />
<br />
<b>6. Bought an ebook reader (tablet) and became a 'Reader':</b> Ever since I had heard about the concept of ebook readers, I was hooked! You could literally carry a whole library with you. Now, that after years of dreaming when I finally got the reader, I have actually become a better reader. Believe it or not but I have finished at least 7-8 books in the last 4-5 months alone. And I plan to do a much better job in the coming year. Way to go RavS!<br />
<br />
<b>7. Didn't visit doctor whole year:</b> In fact, I don't remember going to doctor last year also. Not a single sick leave since last 2.5 years (although there have been some difficult days of cold, cough and fever). All this might not seem like a very big deal. But you need to ask those who have to see doctors, for various reasons, throughout the year. I might not seem the strongest in the pack, but I certainly have a robust immune system and I am fiercely proud of it.<br />
<br />
<b>8. Did quite a few experiments with varied successes :</b> Whether it was&nbsp;<b><a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2013/05/killing-multiple-online-identities.html">killing multiple online</a></b> identities, <b><a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2013/05/why-i-am-leaving-facebook-forever.html">quitting FB</a></b> altogether, being <b><a href="https://medium.com/lessons-learned/e8bd06151d5c">generous for a week</a></b>, doing <b><a href="https://medium.com/p/ffb0993a7429">the moustache experiment</a></b>, or <b><a href="https://medium.com/p/335e71ae6fc9">starting another blog</a></b>, publishing <b><a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2013/05/a-rant-against-society.html">7 posts on a single day</a></b> (it was a disaster, nobody read any), learning to skip ropes (so wanted to learn this) , it's been quite fun doing all this. Even<b><a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2013/01/2013-resolutions.html"> the 3 wishes </a></b>at the start of this year, were a mild success I would argue.<br />
<br />
So, there you go. All these are just top of the mind stuffs. 2013 even after being a pretty standard year did quite a few good things for me. What good did it bring to you?</div>
