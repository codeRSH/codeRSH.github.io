I wrote about Ram Mandir/Babri Masjid dispute [just before the verdict]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-11-07-mandir-vahin-banayenge %}). Now that the verdict has confirm and a lot of people have given their views, I thought it warrants another post elaborating my own views on the verdict. 

First of all, I commend Supreme Court for giving an unanimous judgement on something which just a few days seemed like an impossible task. Having a clear verdict and not going the way of dividing the land gives hope of lasting peace. The Supreme Court has also done a balancing act of giving away 5 Acres of land within Ayodhya to Muslim party so that no one goes with a feeling of having 'lost the case'. 

However, the final verdict definitely seems to favor the faith of a party over the facts and the laws of the land. This doesn't seem right, but I believe it's for the greater good. Because I am dead sure giving that piece of land to Muslim Party would never bring lasting peace. Babri Masjid was razed, if another mosque would have come up now, ultimately that would have got destroyed too. It sounds harsh and unfair but that's the truth. The honorable judges have given the verdict based on a technicality that Hindu Parties presented their case better than Muslims, but I believe they would have kept this point of lasting peace in mind too. 

But all in all, this verdict seems to be more of a mediation than a final judgement on a title suit. If it had to come to this only, I just wish it could have come much much earlier by mediation between the parties themselves. So much enmity could have been avoided and our collective time and energy would have been saved. 

Asaduddin Owaisi has asked the Muslim community to refuse taking the 'compensatory' piece of land saying that they don't want 'alms' and they can themselves buy another piece if they ever wanted. I partially agree with him and can understand his sentiments. But the fact is, in these communal times people and administration in Ayodhya wouldn't allow a Grand Mosque anywhere near the vicinity of proposed temple. Now, that court has ordered this, one can hope there won't be any more trouble at the probable Mosque place. 

I hope Muslim party take the piece of land that's given to them and build a mosque or any other structure to their liking . They may not like it but asking for judicial review or refusing land will only make them look like 'evil'. 

Court and Govt should also ensure that no such disputes happen for any other place. There are so many places where Muslim structure have come up over Hindu places during Mughal period, but we have much more pressing tasks to take care of in our present rather than trying to correct the wrongs of the past. A lot of bloodshed has already happened over Ayodhya. No more Kashi and Mathura should be 'baaki' now. 

A lot of people have asked this question and I also wonder, what would have been the verdict had the Babri Masjid still been there on the site? Would court have ordered its demolition? If court says that placing of idols and demolition of mosque was an illegal act and a contempt of court, then how come it kinda validates the act by allowing the same parties (or their sympathizers) who did this act the power to build a temple? If razing of mosque was illegal, when will the accused be convicted? 

The coverage of media has been completely biased. Bringing all these Maulanas and Muslim scholars only to be bashed by anchor, the other participants and even  the audience. I was shocked to see that even before the verdict had come a few channels were covering it with Lord Ram's photo prominently on display and Ram Bhajans in the background! Either they knew what the verdict was going to come or they had made up their mind about the the 'right' verdict should be. Media persons can have their preferences but this blatant bias of Media is just not good. 

People have fought like lunatics over this Ram Temple. But if Lord Ram would themselves have been around, I am sure he would have refused such a temple. In any case, as I said at the Starting that Supreme Court has in its flawed but commendable verdict tried to pacify both parties in the hope of lasting peace. I hope that happens. 

All said and then, I will wait for both the Grand Temple and new Mosque to be built now and will visit both of them when I visit my hometown. Jai Shri Ram!
