For those who know me and have been following this blog know that I <a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2010/08/why-i-dont-have-mobile.html"><b>never liked</b></a> to keep a phone in my pocket and have a little "<a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2011/01/that-awkward-phone-conversation.html"><b>phono-phobia</b></a>".<br />

<br />
Just over an year ago, I finally caved in to the enormous family and friends' pressure and got myself a mobile phone. Moving into another city in 2 days, it was kind of necessary. And now, after an year I have been reduced to be just another regular phone user.<br />
<br />
And I must say that the experience hasn't been as bad as I feared. <span style="font-size: large;">It's been worse!</span><br />
<br />
<ul>
<li><b>The feeling of being connected all the time:</b> This was the most important reason for not keeping a phone. I am &nbsp;a reserved person and I don't like to be in contact with the world 24x7. I want some personal space and need to cut off from the world from time to time. But ever since acquiring my X2-01, seldom have I parted with it. In fact, I sleep with my phone every night (literally!). Forget weekdays, even weekends are not mine. The number of contacts have increased significantly over the time and so I must now be available round the clock for everyone.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<ul>
<li><b>The anxiety of information: </b>By constant usage, my mind has not ingrained this habit of unconsciously checking the phone every now and then, to see if there are any new messages, phone calls, likes/comments on my latest status update.&nbsp; In fact, the condition is so worse that I have trouble keeping my phone switched off for a few hours .</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<ul>
<li><b>One of the worst forms of distractions:</b> When I didn't have a phone of my own, I used to use a family phone to converse and chat according to My own schedule. But now I need to go according to others' convenience. Which means I would get a phone call or an IM or an SMS in the middle of my working hours. And of course, I can't go without checking them,&nbsp;even if it interrupts my work 'flow'.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<ul>
<li><b>Becoming overly dependent:</b> I use my phone to be in contact with dozens of friends, to see my mails on the go, to tweet/update FB, to learn new words, to google and learn more about something new/news, to write poetry, to listen to music and audio-books, to take occasional interesting snaps, and a million more things. So, if you take away my phone, you take away all those activities from me.</li>
</ul>
<br />
If I have lived without a phone previously, I know I can still survive without it. But I am of the view that a mobile phone is less for you and more for the people known to you.&nbsp; I also understand I am not the only person struggling with these problems, in fact, virtually every phone user will be able to empathize with me.<br />
<br />
Phone is a <i>modern day necessary evil</i>. So, while I can't make it completely go away, I do plan to take a few steps to minimize its damage. Like not checking messages during work hours and to deliberately keep the phone off for a few (pre-scheduled) hours every week. I hope, these steps become successful and things get better in the coming year.</div>
