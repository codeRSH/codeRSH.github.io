Dear God,

How are you? Well before I say anything, I must confess that I was too lazy to write to you, I had to make a sketch, so I asked my friend **RavS** to write this letter to you. But believe me, the emotions are all mine.

So, what to say.. _Matlab_, _pata nahin kya kahun_?

You see, you have given me an awesome life. My friends love me, and though I was abused as a child (_thappad gaal pe padte the impression kahin aur aate the_); I have got the most loving family in the world. I am the king of my home and my brother and sister have to do whatever I say. What else can I ask for.. _Matlab_, _aur kya maangu?_

_Bas mujhko ek hi cheej aur de do.. **Naukri**__.._ hehe, you thought I was gonna ask for _'Chokari'_ but that I want **100** times; after all I have to start my own **clan**. But you see, I want to take retirement soon, from life I mean, _jindagi se mera matlab_. And before I do that, I want to gather all the worldly pleasures and give all the happiness to my family. And a 'job', doesn't matter which kind, is key to that happiness, I think.

You also know that I am a great **artist**. But I want to do so much more, wet my feets in those things that I haven't tried before. So, I try a lot of things, **dancing**, gyming, **photography**, MBA preparation, GATE preparation, MBBS preparation (my biology wasn't bad), NIFT preparation. And it #includes **programming** too. I see everybody near me calling himself/herself a 'programmer' and I want to do that too. I am trying my best, just give me some more wisdom so that I can move from C to Java, from CUI to GUI.

But don't get me wrong God. _Matlab_, _mujhe galat mat samjho Bhagwaan_ .. You have made me an artist. Art is in my blood, and that is not going anywhere. I love to spend late night working on **Photoshop**. Recently I have also started using Corel Draw and Flash, and then **Maya** is always there.

And well I have a life of my own. I am grateful to you that you gave me a 24x7 **Internet** connection. I am currently trying to **download** the whole of Internet on my new 1 TB hard disk. I don't like disturbance, so I like to keep my **door shut**. After all, a creative person needs a lot of time alone. _Matlab_, _sab mila jula ke, rachnatmak vyakti ko apne saath kaafi samay chahiye._ (**XP: yeah what about those 13 hours?** )

Oh God, _matlab_ _hey bhagwaan, ya allah, waahe guru_ etc. Why do all my team mates ask me to get the print outs. Am I a **fax machine**? Sorry, a xerox machine? I contribute so much (**PK: yeah, contribution my arse**) but still they are not happy. They don't like my **awesome ideas**. Those lunatics can't even understand my ideas. Why have you given me such an awesome mind when people can't appreciate it?

In veg I like **baigan**, trishna, torry and kerala. And you know, _matlab aur aapko to pata hi hai, Mujhe_ **_prawn_** _bhi bhot pasand hai. Maine sabhi tareeke ke prawn try kiye hain_. _Main sochta hoon kabhi mujhe bhi koi prawn\* banana sikha de to majaa aa jaaye_. But too much prawn is also not good for health. After all its non veg. Matlab, _sab mila jula ke, ye maansahaari hai_. _Isi liye main share karne me vishwaas karta hoon._ People think prawn is not healthy, but well curiosity about things is never unhealthy. 

I like animals too. I just love **pussy, cat** at my home. I feed it everyday. That to me is the most beautiful thing in the world. That's why I discuss about it all the time. And working with my friend RavS, we have tried to make **_Bhains_** and its parts (_"aankh", "naak", "poonch", "thann_") world famous. But what I like most about it is its **_gobar_**. I don't understand why people think of it as a dirty thing. Its just full of awesome minerals and is multipurpose. Just give those idiots some knowledge. Its insulting when they make noses hearing _gobar_ while eating.

Did I tell you about my movie watching habits. Oh sorry, you are omnipresent _matlab_ _oh maaf karna, aap to sarvagyaata hain._Well, I have got a lot of movies, and I have always been a sharer so my friends also have them (**RavS: Little does he know, I delete them all**). But now having so many **movies** and music, I don't have time to check them all. So, I like to watch specific **scenes**, sometimes just **posters** and because of your gifted psychic powers I can tell the whole movie based on that. So, I don't understand why people need to watch the whole movie. Please give those lesser mortals similar powers, so that they also can save time.

_Accha ab maang hi raha hun to mujhe ek **girl friend**_ _bhi de hi do.. Matlab, hain to bhot saari but koi official nahin hai._ But she has to be bigger than me. That's why I am not building my body. I don't want to look like a king, muscular terrorist of 1987.

I am an open book. You come, you read, you scribble (**RavS: actually you shit**) and you go. But people get me wrong, they think I am a bad person. They call me '_jhand_'. Yeah yeah, I am '_jhand_' but because I want to be human first before becoming superhuman. I am even learning **KunguFu** for that.

And God I think its high time for me to be the **next God**. So that people celebrate Christmas on 24th December instead. Just let me know when you are retiring.

**OK Happy Birthday in advance. Merry Christmas.**

Yours,
**Truly Jhand**
