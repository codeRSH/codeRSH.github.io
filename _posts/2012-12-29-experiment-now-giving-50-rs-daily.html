<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;">I recently reached 100 posts on this blog. Although I am pretty happy with what I have achieved, I'm a tad disappointed as well. It's been 978 days since <a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2010/04/journey-begins.html"><b>my first post </b></a>here and it took me 132 days since <a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2012/12/december-21-when-i-die-tomorrow.html"><b>the 100th one</b></a>. While a lot of excuses for not writing enough can be given, there is no denying the fact that these stats could have been much better.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit;"></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br />
<span style="font-family: inherit;">I read somewhere that <i>a writer
will do anything to excuse himself from writing</i> and I suffer from the
same difficulty. Writing is all about inertia. When you are writing good,
you feel good, which gives a positive feedback to write more good stuffs. Similarly you are not writing, a lot of (unfounded) negative emotions come in, which
makes it even more difficult to write.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br />
<span style="font-family: inherit;">I want to take my writing more seriously now. In fact, I want to reach the next 100 mark in 1/3rd of the time it took this time. And that obviously will require tremendous amount of self discipline and dedication. <b></b></span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit;"></span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit;">Starting January 1, I want to make it a habit of writing uninterrupted for half an hour daily, doesn't matter what. </span><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">And this is where <b>I want an Accountability Partner (AP).</b></span></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;">Here is what I want to try: </span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit;"></span></div>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li><span style="font-family: inherit;">I try to write for (at least) half an hour daily preferably between 10 to 10.30 am.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: inherit;">The Accountability Partner checks DAILY if I am maintaining the habit.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: inherit;">The AP will make sure to remind me daily block half an hour in the 'busy' schedule to write.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: inherit;">In case, I am not able to write for 30 mins (not a minute less), I give 50 Rs. to AP for that day, to be given to them at the end of the month as lump sum.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Though, I am not required to show it to the AP what I wrote.</span> </span></li>
</ol>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;">Of course, there is a scope of cheating here. But then there has to be a degree of trust for this experiment to pass. And while 50 Rs. in a day may not be that big an amount, totalling it for 30 days will make it 1500 which does become a significant amount for me.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit;"></span><br />
<span style="font-family: inherit;">If anybody is interested to become a Writing Accountability Partner for me for this January, please let me know. I am pretty serious about it, and would like someone who can honestly help me out.</span><br />
