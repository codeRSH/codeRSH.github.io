As I am getting older, more and more things keep piling on my plate. A series of tasks personal, familial and professional waiting to drown me, as I wake up in the morning. Many times, it feels overwhelming. It's like being tied to multiple ropes and being stretched from all directions.

Recently, I have tried to deal with it by putting in more hours, longer work days, trying to 'tick' as many tasks for the day as possible. But somehow new tasks pop up and or the day gets wasted in some unknown fluff. All this has led to is more burn out. And I am sure I am not the only one feeling the same.

Now, I feel there is no alternative to it than to focus on a few essentials. But then, the hardest challenge is to decide what's essential and what to leave on the table! That requires sacrifices which many times we are not ready to do. So, we are stuck in this loop of plugging different holes in a broken pipeline, rather than deciding to change the pipeline itself.

There are so many hacks and productivity strategies available online, but I think this Hydra requires more than these tactics to slay. Something needs to change at a more fundamental level. For now, I just feel tired and burned out. I am sure this world has more to offer than an unending list of ToDos.

Although I can't really pinpoint what's the elixir. But, my search continues to find that balance even while I feel sick and tired. I don't know the answer, but I am sure it's not going to be easy. But then, nothing worth achieving in life has ever been easy.
