<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
<span style="font-size: large;">Enough girl, I have had enough,</span><br />
<span style="font-size: large;">I just can't take it anymore,</span><br />
<span style="font-size: large;">I gave you chances, not once but twice,</span><br />
<span style="font-size: large;">Now you don't deserve a third and forth.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: large;">Hey I never asked you to love me,</span><br />
<span style="font-size: large;">Heck if I deserve it, I ain't sure, </span><br />
<span style="font-size: large;">All I wanted was be respected a li'l,</span><br />
<span style="font-size: large;">But you behaved as if I was obscure,</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: large;">I tried my best not to hurt you,</span><br />
<span style="font-size: large;">Doesn't matter if I got hurt doing so,</span><br />
<span style="font-size: large;">But you treated me like a dirt-bag,</span><br />
<span style="font-size: large;">A commodity to pick, use <span style="font-size: large;">'n</span> throw,</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: large;">Yes I liked you, I still do,</span><br />
<span style="font-size: large;">It was Love or what, I don't know,</span><br />
<span style="font-size: large;">I cared for you more than anything else.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: large;">May be that's why you took me for sure.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: large;">You broke my heart,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: large;">I remained silent,&nbsp;</span><br />
<span style="font-size: large;">Got trashed, didn't speak a single word,</span><br />
<span style="font-size: large;">You insulted me, dented my confidence,</span><br />
<span style="font-size: large;">I still kept you first, my thoughts immured,</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: large;">But everything in life, good or bad, comes to an end,&nbsp;</span><br />
<span style="font-size: large;">No miss, I ain't taking it, the way I used to take</span><span style="font-size: large;">&nbsp;before,</span><br />
<span style="font-size: large;">I can't be your toy to play &amp; throw &amp; break,</span><br />
<span style="font-size: large;">A new one you will now have to procure,</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: large;">The beaker of tolerance is overflowing now,</span><br />
<span style="font-size: large;">At <span style="font-size: large;">a</span>ny point of time this volcano can erupt,</span><br />
<span style="font-size: large;">I just hope you go away, far far away from me,</span><br />
<span style="font-size: large;">Because I still don't want you to get hurt.</span></div>
