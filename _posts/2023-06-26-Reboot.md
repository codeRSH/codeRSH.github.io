- # Reboot

  Yeah, I know, I haven't written for a long long time, but it is what it is. Let's give it another try just to see if it gets updated the way I want it.

  I am trying to reboot myself yet again. Who knows this time this attempt might be successful.
  Afterall, I don't have anything else but to keep trying. I like to think of myself as a Writer somewhere who feels more comfortable expressible through written words than verbally. But life takes over again and again and I lose the flow.

  And this causes a certain hollowness inside which I don't like . It's like some part of the life is incomplete. So, I keep coming back every few days, weeks, months or years trying to write hoping this time it will stick. Just this time.

  Let's see where do I reach this time with this. That's all we can hope for.
