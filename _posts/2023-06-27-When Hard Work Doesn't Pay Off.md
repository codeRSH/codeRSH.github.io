For past 1 day I was trying to make something work in a software for which the software wasn't design to work in first place. I spent almost 10+ hours trying to make it work but finally gave up now. 

There is a decent workflow developed for publishing blogs which albeit requires an extra step. Trying to eliminate that extra stuff made me lose so much time. 

It's disappointing but I have hope I learnt something from it. So it wasn't an utter waste.
