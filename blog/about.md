# About Page

I like to call myself RavS. I am an Indian Software Developer by profession.

I am also a struggling blogger and part time beta tester ( who doesn't reveal his findings). I start reading a lot of books but don't finish most of them.

I used to write with a fair bit of regularity a few years ago, but life has taken over the past sometime. But I haven't lost the dream and this site is another attempt to reboot myself as a writer.

If you would like to reach me, you may use the below form. Thanks!
