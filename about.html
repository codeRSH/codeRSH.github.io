<p>My name is Ravi Singh, and my blogger/pen/online name is RavS. I am from India, in case you are not from India. I have been struggling blogger , professional Programmer and part time beta tester ( who doesn’t reveal his findings) .</p>

<p>I read a lot of books but don’t finish most of them ( something I am trying to improve upon).</p>

<p>I am also a ‘struggling’ writer. I used to write with a fair bit of regularity about 5 years ago, but life has taken over the past 5 years, thus bringing my writing to a screeching halt. But I haven’t lost the dream and this site is another attempt to reboot myself as a writer.</p>

<p>If you would like to reach me, then mail me at <em>mail[dot]ravs[at]yahoo[dot]co[dot]in</em> .</p>
