<p>My name is Ravi Singh, and my blogger/pen/online name is RavS. I am currently 30 years. I am from India, in case you are not from India. I have been strugglinig blogger , professional Programmer and part time beta tester ( who doesn’t reveal his findings) . And, of course I like surfing the web ( who doesn’t like it).</p>

<p>In my spare time, I like watching movies, listening to music and watching Cricket ( but not that big an enthusiast in any of this fields).</p>

<p>I also read a lot of books but don’t finish most of them ( something I want to improve upon).</p>

<p>I am a struggling writer, who used to write with a fair bit of regularty about 5 years ago but life has taken over the past 5 years thus bringing my writing to a screeching halt. But I haven’t lost the dream and this site is another attempt to reboot myself as a writer.</p>

<p>I will update this page as and when I feel like. However, if you would like to reach me, then mail me at <em>mail[dot]ravs[at]yahoo[dot]co[dot]in</em> or send me a tweet.</p>
