<p>I like to call myself RavS. I am an Indian Software Developer by profession. I am also a struggling blogger and part time beta tester ( who doesn’t reveal his findings) .</p>

<p>I start reading a lot of books but don’t finish most of them ( something I am trying to improve upon).</p>

<p>I used to write with a fair bit of regularity a few years ago, but life has taken over the past sometime, thus bringing my writing to a screeching halt. But I haven’t lost the dream and this site is another attempt to reboot myself as a writer.</p>

<p>If you would like to reach me, then mail me at <em>mail[dot]ravs[at]yahoo[dot]co[dot]in</em> .</p>
