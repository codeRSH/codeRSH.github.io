# About Page

I like to call myself RavS. I am an Indian Software Developer by profession. I am also a struggling blogger and part time beta tester ( who doesn't reveal his findings) .

I start reading a lot of books but don't finish most of them ( something I am trying to improve upon).

I used to write with a fair bit of regularity a few years ago, but life has taken over the past sometime, thus bringing my writing to a screeching halt. But I haven't lost the dream and this site is another attempt to reboot myself as a writer.

If you would like to reach me, then mail me at _mail[dot]ravs[at]yahoo[dot]com_ .
