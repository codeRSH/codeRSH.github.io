<h1 id="new-year-post">New Year Post</h1>

<p>Yes right, I am writing this new year post almost 4 months after the new year has started. But this is part of setting up my Website.</p>

<p>I hope I am able to write regularly on this site going forward. If not daily then at least once or twice a week. Making a habit of updating this blog/site is one of th my ambitions. I hope I am able to be successful in this endevour. At one point when I feel I doing perfectly fine along with the them and other stuff then I plan to move my blogrsh.blogspot.in blog on here.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s hope everything goes as per the plan.</p>
