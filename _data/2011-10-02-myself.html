<div style="text-align: justify;">
OK, so I am finally writing about myself. And it's funny that one thing that I should have posted a long time ago, I am doing it now. Well there is a reason for that: it's really hard to define your own self. I think that's what people call discovering yourself, and it takes the whole life to "actually" get to know yourself. Anyways, without wasting my blog space and your precious time I would like to present to you,&nbsp;<b>Myself &lt;</b>drumrolls<b>&gt;</b>:</div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: justify;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: justify;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">My name is&nbsp;</span><b style="font-family: inherit;">Ravi Singh</b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">, and my blogger/pen/online name is&nbsp;</span><b style="font-family: inherit;">RavS</b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">. I am <strike>23</strike> 25 years old (though I am not really proud of the fact). I am from India, in case you are not from India. I like a variety of stuffs... related to computers! So, that includes Blogging, Programming, tinkering with the OS, trying out new&nbsp;</span>softwares<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;(I am a part time beta tester, who doesn't reveal his findings!) and of course surfing the web (well&nbsp;</span><b style="font-family: inherit;">mostly</b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;surfing the web).</span></div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: justify;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: justify;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">I love music (but I know I am not the&nbsp;greatest&nbsp;music loving creature alive). I like so many music genres (Rock) and artists (Taylor Swift) that it's really impossible to tell which one is my favorite (Himesh Reshammiyya). Basically I can hear anything under the sky and it all depends on my mood. I am also a movie watcher (though a much better movie collector) and again there is no clear favorite actor (Tom Cruise) or actress (Angelina Jolie) or genre (Comedy) that I could name.</span></div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: justify;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: justify;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">I am an awesome procrastinator, but I am too humble to brag about my superpowers. I am an introvert and shy guy. I sometimes don't bath and message all my friends to tell my achievements. I am a lousy artist, but &nbsp;that's because I don't want to give complex to people&nbsp;<b><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLAyKJIZNfc">like these</a></b>. Alright, alright. I know you would be thinking why am I writing these&nbsp;</span>negative<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;traits. Well actually I am a fan of&nbsp;<b><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/2yH9eL4dIFbBaj9g6M8K-snaiJDG5tnUNhCR7MqnxB4?feat=directlink">Sjain</a></b>&nbsp;in this regard, who thinks &nbsp;shouting about your negative features is actually a positive thing. And hey, you only wanted to read "Myself", (I didn't ask you ;) and now that I am writing "Myself" myself, you are criticizing me? That's not coo! Read on...</span></div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: justify;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: justify;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">But I like to have my own opinion (Justine B. sucks), but never get annoyed at anyone (****** you R. Black, you have&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iSRr3ZuLL8"><b>ruined my Fridays</b></a>). I love all my friends (</span>except<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;<b><a href="http://img.izismile.com/img/img2/20090409/windows_03.jpg">XP</a></b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.clipartreview.com/_images_300/3D_frog_holding_a_syringe_needle_100616-115629-661009.jpg"><b>Sui</b></a>) and am usually happy for them (yeah, whatever...). I always praise my&nbsp;<a href="http://thetrashpandiary.blogspot.com/2011/07/same-crap-new-avatar.html"><b>friends' work</b></a>&nbsp;(secretly it annoys me to see how&nbsp;<a href="http://herowerozero.blogspot.com/2010/04/3-feet-to-left-2-n-half-feet-to-right.html"><b><span id="goog_1260106857"></span>awesome</b></a><u style="font-weight: bold;"><span id="goog_1260106858"></span></u>&nbsp;they are, so I fake it). I think we should always try and keep improving ourselves (yesterday I watched more TV shows than the day before) and try to help everyone (except XP and Sui).&nbsp;</span></div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: justify;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: justify;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">I have got a really big nuclear family (not the radioactive kind, idiot) and I am the only eldest brother in the family. I am self unemployed in an Indian company. I have really high dreams (one time I scared the hell out of terrorists with an empty gun, in my dreams). I am punctual (never late more than 2 hours). I am always impartial/neutral in my views (as long as you are talking about&nbsp;<a href="https://profiles.google.com/116383458948697205445/posts/17WTepC2GDP"><b>something I like</b></a>). I don't like to pressurize anyone (until they keep reading and commenting on my posts).</span></div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: justify;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: justify;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">I do not support piracy (I am also a hypocrite) and I am a full fledged GNU/Linux supporter (mostly because of their&nbsp;<b><a href="http://thetrashpandiary.blogspot.com/2011/07/illustrationmy-first-wallpaper.html">bull/penguin logo</a></b>). Microsoft is my favorite company (to curse against, while using their products). I am super&nbsp;</span>athletic<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;&amp; fit and I rarely lie about anything. I am a gifted singer-cum-dancer and I also have a great sense of humour.</span></div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: justify;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: justify;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">Well that's pretty much it. If you gotta know more about me, I would think either you have a crush on me (OK if you are girl, not Ok if you are not a girl) or are spying on me (OK if you are girl, not Ok if you are not a girl). In a really rare case you may be plain curious (OK if you are a girl or not). In any case, just drop me a&nbsp;<b><a href="mailto:mailme@notsharingmy.info">mail</a></b>/<a href="http://twitter.com/twitRSH"><b>tweet</b></a>.</span></div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: justify;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="margin: 0px; text-align: justify;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">Cheers!</span></div>
