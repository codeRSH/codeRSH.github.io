OK, so I thought of something different this time. I asked my colleagues/friends to write down something like a guest post for me, on a common topic. And I chose the topic <u>*Superstition*</u> because I thought we were bound to get different opinions. I even&nbsp;didn't&nbsp;let them see each other’s post, so their own views&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;get influenced. I gotta say, I&nbsp;wasn't&nbsp;disappointed! Indulge:<br />
<br />
<b><u>IMPORTANT</u></b>: To really enjoy this post, go to comment section and post your own "uninfluenced" views on <b>Superstition</b> BEFORE reading this.&nbsp;Do you believe it works, or&nbsp;doesn't? Or there is nothing like superstition at all? We all will be happy to hear more about this topic.</div>

<b>My definition:</b><br />
Superstition to me is more of a mental state of comfort than just a word which&nbsp;has often been used in the negative sense. When I say that, I mean to say we all&nbsp;are superstitious at some level; it’s just that the degree of superstition varies from&nbsp;person to person. To me there is a very thin line between superstition and faith&nbsp;or should I put it this way? Superstition is just a manifestation of faith. The more&nbsp;blind faith gets, the more superstitious we become but hasn’t faith been always&nbsp;blind?<br />
<br />
<b>Few personal observations:</b><br />
Superstition has no logic. It roots from within, the feeling that gives us this hope&nbsp;that things will work once we tread the path guided by it. Gut feeling, intuition,&nbsp;and sixth sense whatever you call it doesn’t make a difference. I have these small&nbsp;superstitions of my own and I would love to put them here because they have&nbsp;in a way given me belief which at times was defied by logic. For example, I never&nbsp;enter into my exam hall first (I let the others to lead). I make sure I wear the same&nbsp;shirt for all my exams (my deo proves to be real help in these times ;)) also; I use&nbsp;same pen and pencil throughout the exams. In daily life, I’ve this feeling that my&nbsp;Fridays tend to go bad as compared to other days and mind you, it has happened&nbsp;quite a number of times. Well, there are many more such small but interesting&nbsp;observations but I think they are too personal to share on a public forum. ;)<br />
<br />
<b>How to differentiate between faith and superstition?</b><br />
Here comes the most important question. As I’ve said before, there is a very&nbsp;thin line between the two and I’ve my own way of differentiation. As long as&nbsp;your superstitions don’t interfere with the personal space of another person,&nbsp;as long as they don’t affect others directly or indirectly, as long as they remain&nbsp;within secure and safe they give us strength, belief and confidence, they remain&nbsp;within boundaries of faith. I read somewhere; our karma is tied with our intuition.<br />
<br />
Just follow this mantra. Whatever gives us hope should be followed but within&nbsp;boundaries.<br />
<br />
<b>Conclusion:</b><br />
Friends, ignorance should not be confused with faith. What I’ve tried here is&nbsp;to present a new dimension to this topic. In a nutshell whether u call it faith or&nbsp;superstition, they are two sides of the same coin.<br />

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Everybody has an idea of the textbook definition of superstition. But as we all have our own perspective towards things, I’ll tell my viewpoint. Well, when I think of it I come up with a couple of different things in my mind. But before that I want to tell that I am NOT superstitious at all. I think:</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<b>1. Superstition is the unjustified fear :&nbsp;</b></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
When you say someone to behave in some particular way for example one should not let a shoe or a 'chappal' lie flipped over, s/he will probably say "What? pfft.. Why? Is that a new law?". At this time s/he is behaving rational because it makes no sense. But if you say that one should not let'em flipped over because some "ghost" won’t like it or you'll get failed in your exam, s/he will look for every flipped flip-flop to fix that. All the thinking gets crushed under the "shoe" (pun intended) and intellect disappears like a ghost (not intended this time) because of the fear factor. Sparingly people will think how a shoe can flip (intended again) the exam prospect.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<b>2. Superstition is an excuse for the failures and unexplained happenings:</b></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Well this is quite self explaining; if somebody fails s/he says that is because somebody sneezed or everybody's all time favorite "nazar lag gayi". Same goes for most of the unexplained incidents and coincidences.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
I think this is ridiculous. It is not that I never had superstitions but as we grow we no longer blindly believe EVERYTHING we hear/see because we develop our own conscience and beliefs. One can get rid of them easily if one really wants to, eliminate the fear and take responsibility of your failures.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
PS: I also fix the flipped over shoes, but that because the bottom part looks dirty. J</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Superstition <b><a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2011/02/self-made-god.html">like God</a></b> has been a fascinating (and confusing) topic for me. Because I believe it doesn’t &nbsp;usually work, but I still do have a few superstitions of my own. Now, that can be called intelligence (entertaining 2 conflicting thoughts together and still be able to work) or hypocrisy. &nbsp;To me again it’s more or less a matter of convenience. When I need it (like when in trouble) I believe in it. Other times I try and be rational about it (like while writing a blog post!).</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
So, why do I require superstitions? Well sometimes they just become habit (wearing left sock before right), sometimes they teach good manners (seeking blessing from elders before starting something good) while at other times they just give you confidence (taking God’s name before writing roll number on the question paper). And I think all of these reasons are pretty good excuses to have a few superstitions.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
And how do I know they don’t work? Well, if a superstition is so much effective, it gotta work every time to your advantage. For what I have found, it doesn’t. And having blind faith and superstition always causes more harm than good.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
So I think having superstitions isn’t bad as long as we know how to manage them.</div>

superstiiton</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Ø &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I think Its yield of immature &nbsp;part of our mind.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Ø &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If it is not harming us and ppl around &nbsp;what’s wrong in having some.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Ø &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It should not turned into full fledged black magic or&nbsp;slaughtering &nbsp;which illiterate part of our society accustomed to.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Ø &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I think everybody has some including ppl with pragmatic and&nbsp;radical ideology</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Ø &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It should not effect our approach , decision or anything during&nbsp;course of particular action , better should be confined to&nbsp;pre-inception of any practice.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Ø &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have some (wont disclose) inherited or instilled by family&nbsp;and I do try to satisfy them before any big move .Actually assessed&nbsp;the outcome of situation done with and without satisfying superstition&nbsp;and realised &nbsp;that in former case situation turned in favor of me .</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Ø &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So do have some , but don’t let it to take over your mind ,&nbsp;have self believe ,execute your job and don’t get complacent by just&nbsp;satisfying some trivial superstition.</div>

Superstition......!!!!</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
whatever it is........???</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
I don give it a shit....!!!</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

<div style="text-align: justify;">
One can fullfill his own goals..</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
none else gonna do it for him...</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
so rather believing such things which even doesn't exist,</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
one should believe in himself...</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
And if if he meets any obstruction in his way..</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
then...he should check how strongly...he wants his dreams or goals to be fulfilled..</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
actually this is something called as WILL POWER..</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
so if anything comes in way..then one's WILL POWER has to be strong enough to counter all this obstructions..</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
and Not only will power will do anything...</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
actually.."Will Power" has to accompanied with "Self belief"..</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
and...</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
one last thing....."NEVER GIVE UP"</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
..</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
If one lives his life with these three...</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
he wud never end up being suertious in life..</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

Well, regarding superstition, i can say everyone use to cross from such situation in his LIFE. I am not saying that always. But whenever required ,a person talks to his soul and God ,to raise his bloody Luck so that he , one day, can rise n shine in his world. Similar to such person, i m too superstitious. Don't be exclaimed !! I m guy who tends to such things.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">
<br /></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">
I dun believe much in that but in some YES!! &nbsp;Well that's too because they have reasons behind. Like i never cross road when KITTY cross that damn road. I let other first cross it nd then move on. Once, I tried to ignore this and faced a very critical situation and also get scolded by my parents.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">
<br /></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">
Similarly, I do only stuffs in which i get frightened up. Because, i know that i didn't had worked hard in that thing. So, i leave that work on God and on my Luck. If it become successful, I become very happy and praise God for keeping faith in me. But when i fail, i curse &nbsp;my bit- left Gud luck so much for not making me successful. Well, i believe that everyone do so. I mean this much. And i too know that wherever i haven't worked hard, i can face 50-50% chance to get pass and fail. I know that if i would have worked hard scene would be something i expected. That's why i never curse God , because its my mistake. Heheheh.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">
<br /></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">
Anyways, i m also not in very much deep in such thing. As, u have seen me that i never wear Weird Necklaces, Bracelets, Rings and other stuff for such thing. I just keep believe in me and my GOD. I never pray to God before crossing road, i just look to the either sides and then cross. Its simple. I don't think if i travel outside of my home, what will happen to me.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">
<br /></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">
But there is another fact also, that i believe that i have sixeth sense which few think is also Superstitious thing. As, Science only believe in Facts not in Gifts from GOD.But believe is only thing that makes you strong and after God i believe in what i BELIEVE.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">

<b>"omg that black cat crossed my way, now what am i going to do"</b></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<b>"damn it, you sneezed when i was about to get out for my office"</b></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<b>"this pen is lucky for me, it always gets me good marks"</b></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Now in a slight different way......</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<b>"i met an accident because a black cat crossed my way"</b></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<b>"i got late because you sneezed when i went out for office"</b></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<b>"i didn't get good marks coz i didnt have the lucky pen with me this time"</b></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Call it blind faith, naive belief or popular notion, the old stories of ghosts and demons may have been replaced with the aforesaid comments but Superstition as we all know has irrationally and irrevocably survived in some form or other even as we have advanced from the stone age to the modern age.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
The saddest part is that its not just our elder but our friends, siblings and even some people related to Science who have become superstitious. There ought to be some reason why so many of us consider it more important than anything else in our life.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
I dont know the reason but here is what i believe.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<b>"Our heart is very delicate, it gets afraid of even the trivial things when under pressure, and in such a situation we try to relax it by tricking it into believing Aal iz well."&nbsp;</b></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
This is where Superstition comes in handy. People use them to avoid the pressure situation and as an excuse for not being able to stand upto the expectations. We can always blame things that dont exist, doesnt matter even if it was our fault. The best part is that &nbsp;we dont need to explain ourselves in front of anyone for something that was caused by a bad omen.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
So next time you think of something superstitious better say Aal iz Well. It wont make things better but yeah it gives us the courage &nbsp;and strength to face the situation ;)</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
