<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 18px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">Well its frustrating,<br />Don't you think so?<br />When you have to say something,<br />But have no one to go.<br /><br />Yes there are parents, but lets admit,<br />We haven't been as close to them.<br />Well may be when we were kids,<br />but now life's all different and grim.<br /><br />Of course, there are friends to give a shout,<br />but they got their own problems too.<br />You don't want to freak them out,<br />and give them yours to chew.<br /><br />Yeah, nowadays you have 'The Internet'<br />You can spend your whole life exploring.<br />But when you realize its hollower than thou,<br />It feels incredibly boring.<br />Google after all, is not the answer,<br />Not for everything.<br /><br />Sometimes in life you hit a low patch.<br />And you seek someone to come hold you,<br />say "you idiot, why did you fall?"<br />and then listens to all your excuses,<br />without taking a call.<br />(I realize, one can do the same,<br />by standing in front of wall :)<br /><br />And here goes inner pessimist:<br />"Hey, why would anyone choose a loser?<br />And if there is anyone, 'that' crazy,<br />Why would she choose me,<br />since losers are in majority."<br /><br />So, you sit there alone,<br />or may be talk a walk.. lonely.<br />Oh God why this life sux,<br />Why can't I have a problem alley?<br /><br />You don't always listen to me,<br />All I want is someone to listen.<br />But isn't made of concrete,<br />but blood and flesh.<br />OK not just a problem fellow,<br />but someone to share life's mess.<br />Someone a bit more intimate.<br />So you don't second guess,<br />just say and don't regret.<br /><br />And when you realize its nowhere near you,<br />the frustration amplifies,<br />Noise in head screams out loud,<br />And the inner you silently cries.<br /><br />Wanted to end this piece on a happy note,<br />say there is still battle to be fought.<br />That the 'solution' to problems is waiting somewhere,<br />eager to be found out.<br />Yes, hope is still there,<br />but that's dwindling day by day.<br />Becoming more and more difficult to tell now,<br />how much longer its gonna stay.<br /><br /><b>Is my faith weak or the 'fix' doesn't exist?</b></span></span></div>
