<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
<br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Story behind this blog is a long one and I would try to keep it short, just giving the relevant details and cutting off the fluff (and putting in the facts to the best of my memory).</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;">This all started during the January of 2007. I was preparing for my&nbsp;</span>engineering<span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;entrances. Around that time I got my hands on a short book about blogging. I knew just a little bit about blogs, then. I read the book from cover to cover and after reading it, I knew I wanted to have a blog of my own, one day.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;">But the problem was that I didn't have an Internet connection at home (broadband was just getting popular). And I wanted to have only good comprehensive researched articles on my blog (which, now I know, nobody reads!). And I wanted to have a regular set of readers who would expect consistency. I did make an account on Blogger and reserve a domain, played a little bit with the layout and so on. I also wrote 2-3 lines on the blog, promising to come back and write more but that never really came.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;">Then I got admission in college and other things took importance, one of my friends by that time had started <b><a href="http://herowerozero.blogspot.com/">his own blog</a></b> and I always encouraged him to write <b><a href="http://herowerozero.blogspot.com/2008/08/sand-of-time.html">more &amp; more</a></b> and <b><a href="http://herowerozero.blogspot.com/2010/04/my-experiment-with-faith.html">better &amp; better</a></b>; because in a way I used to imagine, someday my blog also getting the <b><a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2011/08/blog-post_26.html?showComment=1314422897837#c4233094452585982131">similar kinds of reactions</a></b>. In fact, whenever I came to know about <b><a href="http://vksingh007.blogspot.com/2009/04/bright-shades-of-darkness.html">any blog of my friends</a></b>, I have made it a point to actually <b><a href="http://anewexpression.blogspot.com/2010/11/reason-to-blog.html">read it and comment</a></b>. By doing that I was creating a ready-made followers for my own blog, without even starting it yet! (But <b><a href="http://myview-saurabh.blogspot.com/2009/07/indias-defeat-in-t20-2009-so-t20-world.html">my comments were</a></b> and <b><a href="http://skandgupt.blogspot.com/2011/08/ubuntu-wallpaper-n-wallpaper-skand_11.html">will always be</a></b> genuine :).</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;">Then during the winters of 2007-2008, I said <i>"what the heck, let me start the blog, if it fails, then so be it"</i>. So, I wrote an article on the ongoing India-Australia test series (Cricket is one of the easiest topic an Indian can get to blog on!). But I never really got to publishing that one (again not having a net connection was the reason and pen drives weren't fully popular by then, so transferring data was also a pain).</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;">So, again it went into a cold bag. Now, there is nothing more stressing than a work half done. While I got busy clearing the semesters, the thought of making the blog always remained&nbsp;</span>buried<span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;inside. During the start of 2010 when I finally got an Internet connection, it was a perfect opportunity to start the blog, so I did go around in reserving a domain again and writing a <b><a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2010/04/journey-begins.html">short blog post.</a></b></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;">But again there was this flaw in thinking, that my blog posts should be large and comprehensive to be taken seriously. So, once again I couldn't go beyond the first post (which was just an introduction and nothing else).</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;">During the summer-break of 2010, I came up with another idea (I am usually good in devising ideas, it's the implementation that's mainly the problem :). The plan was that instead of writing a blog, why not go short and start a mini-blog of sort. So, I wrote <b><a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2010/07/buzzrsh-when-it-all-started.html">this post</a></b> to 8 of my closest friends. And after a writer's block of 1-2 weeks it <b><a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2010/07/i-no-longer-want-to-be-engineer.html">finally started</a></b>!</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;">Writing blogs also follows the principle of&nbsp;</span>inertia<span style="font-family: inherit;">. When you haven't written for a long time, it is just kind of hard to start again. But once you somehow start writing (and posting) and getting <b><a href="http://blogrsh.blogspot.com/2011/08/blog-post_26.html?showComment=1314623785154#c7006818511029539635">encouraging responses</a></b>, you are on a roll, and you start to crank up posts after posts. If you check out the&nbsp;</span>archives<span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;section and see the the dates of my blog posts, you will see that my writing was stuck at least 2-3 times, but there have also been time, where I posted 2-3 times per week.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: inherit;">But persistence is the key. I persisted while facing difficulties and here we are! This blog is over one year old! Today I have a full fledged blog with over 50 posts and set of low numbered but consistent readers (friends :)! Hopefully, in next one year we will make it even bigger &amp; better :)</span></div>
