<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 18px;">About 4 weeks ago I got 3 messages on the occasion of Friendship day. One message felt like it was made out of a Christmas SMS, so it felt more of an obligation for the day. Another felt apologetic for wishing, since the person knew I don't believe in Friendship day. And the third message was guilt ridden, since it came late to me! And it was amusing, because I never wanted any of those messages to remind me that they were one of my most cherished friends.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 18px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">Anyway, that prompted me to think about what all days hold importance in my life, and which ones don't. This post is a result of that. Here is the list of few days (not in any order) and why they are or aren't important to me..</span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 18px;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 18px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">1.&nbsp;<b>The Independence Day</b>: OK I may not be the best patriot this country has ever produced, but that doesn't stop me of feeling proud to be an Indian, even after all the shortcomings it has. <i>"..Koi bhi desh perfect nahin hota, use perfect banana padata hai.."</i>. I like to spend the day giving some thoughts to India and its problems and resolving to do something for this country, howsoever small.</span></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 18px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">2.&nbsp;<b>Diwali</b>: It used to be night of crackers when I was a kid. But now, I 'say no to crackers'. But this is the day I try and greet all my friends, old and new. Ones whom I meet everyday or talk to once in a year. This is the day I genuinely feel happy and look forward to every year. This is one of those days that you feel like it happened yesterday.</span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 18px;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 18px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">3.&nbsp;<b>The New Years Day</b>: Pretty obvious. Who doesn't like to welcome the new year. This is the day for me to leave the painful memories of the past behind and look forward to days to come. Plus this is a global festival. So you celebrate with the whole earth!</span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 18px;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 18px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">4.&nbsp;<b>Dusshera/Durgapuja</b>&nbsp;: I miss going to midnight RamLila or Durgapuja. Sitting on ground with common people watching poor actors enact human gods. I felt connected to my roots. But still I don't miss out on watching the climax of the epic saga. The burning of effigies. You want your inner demons also to burn with the symbolic ones.</span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 18px;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 18px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">5.&nbsp;<b>Birthdays(Friends/Family)</b>: These days hold prime importance in my life. This is the day to make your loved ones happy. Try not to miss the opportunity. Buying gifts is the small part, the important thing is to make the day special for them, so that they can remember it in the days to come.</span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 18px;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 18px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">6.&nbsp;<b>Birthday(Mine)</b>: NO. I don't like celebrating my birthday. And it has nothing to do with the date of my birthday. When I was young this was the day to look forward to, since I got to wear new clothes, cut the cake, and party with friends. And I liked growing, I mean physically. I don't see that growth happening any more, and I don't see any improvements in my EQ level too, which means I am just aging. There is nothing to celebrate about it. I think this is the best period of the only life I have got. Birthday reminds me that time is going away. So, I like to keep a low profile this day, spending it quietly. That's the way I 'celebrate' my birthday.</span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 18px;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 18px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">7.&nbsp;<b>Holi</b>: Why is that every festival that you look forward to as a kid, looses its sheen when you grow up? Nothing special for me on this day, except good food to eat. Haven't played with colors for last 5 years. Boring personality, eh?</span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 18px;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit; line-height: 18px;">8.&nbsp;<b>Father's Day/Mother's Day/Friendship Day/Valentine Day/Rose Day/God-knows-which Day</b></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 18px;">: I consider all these days to be nothing but marketing gimmick. People just want to play with your sentiments by offering various products for various days. Of course making money in the process too. And we people also take this opportunity to shower all our love for the whole year by forwarding to every person in the contact list the chain&nbsp;</span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 18px;">messages</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 18px;">&nbsp;we got from others! I would rather like to celebrate Sis day (Rakhi) and Teachers' day, since they are based on culture rather than commerce.</span></span></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 18px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">9.&nbsp;<b>Festivals of other religions</b>: I am a Hindu but I have equal respect for all religions. So, I look forward to days like Eid, Lohri, Christmas, Buddha Purnima. Alas, don't have many to share my happiness on these days. But I celebrate them in my own special small way.</span></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 18px;">10.&nbsp;<b>Sunday</b></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 18px;">: I look forward to this holiday. Spend it in my own special way (more on this some other time). Thank God, (or the human who made the Gregarion Calender) for providing this day once every week. I don't need to highlight the importance of this day in any working person's life. </span></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit; line-height: 18px;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit; line-height: 18px;"> Alright, so this is it. These are the days that I could think of as being most (or less) important in my life. What do you think? Which are your favorite days? Drop in a comment on the 'comments' thread.</span></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 18px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"><b>PS:</b>&nbsp;If given the powers and the authority, I would like to create my own days like&nbsp;<b>JhanDay</b>&nbsp;(personalized version of Fool's day),&nbsp;<b>Bhains-ki-day</b>&nbsp;(I believe buffalo should get as much respect as holy cow),&nbsp;<b>Gaddhay</b>&nbsp;(Lets make our city a better and safe place to leave in by filling potholes and covering manholes).</span></span></div>
